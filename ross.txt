 Ross:... finally...
 Ross:God youre amazing... I didnt even have to ask you to call me that.
 Ross:Weh...*sigh*
 Ross:Yeah Its just... I dont think I can do this...
 Ross:No NO! (theyre moving to the side of the bed where they sit down) Look I need to talk to Joey. I mean you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us I need to know hes okay with it.
 Ross:Alright Im gonna go find them... (twitches a bit looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay I see you later.

 Ross:Well if you see him could you please tell him Im looking for him?
 Ross:Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)

 Ross:(knocks) Rach?
 Ross:Is everything okay?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:You know where Joey is?
 Ross:Can I talk to you for a minute?
 Ross:And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
 Ross:And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
 Ross:Anyway one thing lead to another and... oh... before you know it we were kissing. I mean how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
 Ross:You know I gotta go find him. Hes gotta be here someplace.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You guys ready to go?
 Ross:Dude! Youre not taking your Bible?
 Ross:Learn about Jesus...
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Uh no... no. I couldnt find him. Im just gonna talk to him on the plane.
 Ross:Stop it!
 Ross:Youre filthy!
 Ross:Uh actually I think she went to the salon.
 Ross:Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
 Ross:Youve never said that in your life have you?
 Ross:I thought so.
 Ross:Oh I uh I mean I... dude I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
 Ross:No Ill do it. (he quickly grabs Joeys boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)
 Ross:Right Im gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. Hes always in a good mood after the flight attendant says duty free.
 Ross:Hey Rach...
 Ross:Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:So I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
 Ross:Okay last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that by the way... Well Charlie and I were talking and... well...
 Ross:Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?
 Ross:Yeah we kissed but... nothing else... nothing else happened okay.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Are you serious?
 Ross:I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean youre an incredible friend you know that?
 Ross:No I mean it. You are so loyal man and selfless and generous...
 Ross:You know what? I know Chandler longer so I always think of him as my best friend but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
 Ross:Hey if there is ever anything I can do for you...

 Ross:Ah yeah. We had a really good talk.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Oh no its great. Its great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
 Ross:Well Im so excited about this.
 Ross:Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
 Ross:(gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)
 Ross:Ooh hey Emma daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.

 Ross:I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! Youre gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) Im just kidding I know Rachel I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come please come in. Come in.
 Ross:Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) Shes a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
 Ross:Underwear a toothbrush and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
 Ross:What? Fine? Because I am! Arent you? Arent you? Arent you? You see? Who else is fine?
 Ross:You know what? That is a very good idea. Im gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.

 Ross:Oh guys this is fun isnt it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin.
 Ross:Im fine! Hey Im great! Im just.. Im just proud of us. Theres no weirdness no tension.

 Ross:That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
 Ross:Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
 Ross:And to love. Ah love. L-O-V-E love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
 Ross:O is for oh wow! The V is for this very surprising turn of events which Im still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
 Ross:Totally.
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Wasnt it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Okay I guess its just flan for three! Hey hey that rhymed!
 Ross:Oh oh. Of course. God Im so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean you probably just want to be alone.
 Ross:Hey hey its fine. Its totally fine. Weve got plenty of margaritas. Its all good.
 Ross:I dont even know what thats for.
 Ross:Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
 Ross:So you took off my pants and shoes?
 Ross:What do you mean?
 Ross:Hey what are you talking about? Im fine!
 Ross:Except were not. I mean we havent been a couple in like six years. Oh my god is that right? Has it been that long?
 Ross:This is crazy. I mean six years? And because of me you guys arent gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really what is this thing with you and Rachel?
 Ross:Joey.
 Ross:And she feels the same way?
 Ross:Well then maybe its time we all moved on.
 Ross:No but I wanna be. Hey I will be. Besides Im with Charlie right? Oh my god Im still with Charlie arent I? I mean she didnt see the dance did she?
 Ross:Yeah Im sure.

 Ross:Im sorry its just... how did you get so tan?
 Ross:Eh you got a spray-on tan?
 Ross:(laughing) Why why you do like with the-the toe separators?
 Ross:Still I cant believe thats sprayed on... I mean it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
 Ross:So do you get colours or just French tips?
 Ross:Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)

 Ross:Im a four?
 Ross:(sarcastically) Really!
 Ross:(annoyed) Ok!
 Ross:Wait wait a minute theres no light on the back wall! How do I know when its gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins on his face) Ah oh ah! (he turns but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!
 Ross:(hysterically) Im an eight!
 Ross:I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
 Ross:Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. Theres a distinct line across his body where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
 Ross:(looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?
 Ross:(Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters sees him and starts laughing)
 Ross:(Still yelling) I Know!
 Ross:Im gonna stop you right there Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time huh? Now I want 4 twos... and I want them all on my back.
 Ross:Wait a minute theres two sets of nozzles which one is it?
 Ross:Which... which... which... Which one is it?
 Ross:OH! SON OF A BITCH!
 Ross:Go away! I dont want to see anybody.
 Ross:Really? Did you count Mississipily?
 Ross:Dude youre not tanned.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Cmon you guys this is really important to us.

 Ross:Hey I brought the camera for Emmas video.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Thats the hope! So is Emma awake yet?
 Ross:Ah and where is Joey?

 Ross:Joey NO!
 Ross:When they see this youll be 52!

 Ross:Oh great!
 Ross:Thank you so much for that gift!
 Ross:Amazing... amazing.
 Ross:Sure.
 Ross:Uh Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
 Ross:I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
 Ross:Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!
 Ross:Hey Mon that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
 Ross:Well you know what? While were waiting you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!
 Ross:You guys just please.. a little bit longer. I promise Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica remember.. the frosting? huh?
 Ross:(Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok Ill be right there. (Puts the phone down)
 Ross:No Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
 Ross:No wait ! You guys no no you cant leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cakes messed up. How do you think shes gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
 Ross:Joey! Youre in charge ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
 Ross:RACHEL!
 Ross:(sarcastically) I cant believe they gave you a ticket. Youre such a good driver.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Hey maybe I can fix that you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)
 Ross:Rach shes not going to remember this.
 Ross:(looks back at the cake) Hey!
 Ross:Its not bad.
 Ross:Well I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
 Ross:Some can sing some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
 Ross:Joey we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
 Ross:Oh my God! Our daughters a genius! Rach this means...
 Ross:Damnit! Ill put a candle on the cake.
 Ross:Okay here we go! Emmas first birthday cake... Well hey... well blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
 Ross:Whats wrong? Are you okay?
 Ross:Okay you ready?

 Ross:(gives up) Yes yes you did.
 Ross:Hi Rachel! Heres your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
 Ross:Ehm... Her name is Emma.
 Ross:What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
 Ross:(to Joey) Oh my God!
 Ross:What... what you working on?
 Ross:Why dont you use your Thesaurus?
 Ross:Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
 Ross:Seriously?
 Ross:Well do you wanna marry him?
 Ross:Absolutely! Youll love the feeling! Theres nothing like it!
 Ross:No I cant. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throats been hurting?
 Ross:I dont think thats what this is.
 Ross:(He interrupts her immediately and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well can I talk to you for a sec.?
 Ross:Um I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
 Ross:Well for one thing she keeps calling her Ella!
 Ross:Fine well call the next one Ella.
 Ross:(a little confused) Okay um... I dont want her watching our baby.
 Ross:I... I dont know..
 Ross:Hey guys. 
 Ross:Hey Emma. Oh why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off but Rachel tries to stop him).
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:Come here (Removes Emmas hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
 Ross:(sees how strangely Monica Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
 Ross:(Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.
 Ross:Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldnt have left Emma with her!
 Ross:Thats not a thing!
 Ross:(very angry) Amy I ju... I just... I just wanna...
 Ross:(pointing at Amy shouting) No more falafel for you!
 Ross:Pheebs whats wrong?
 Ross:So did he get on one knee did he have a speech prepared or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah big surprise I like proposals!
 Ross:(to Charlie) Hey!
 Ross:Guess whos a finalist for a huge research grant! Ill give you a hint hes looking right at you.
 Ross:Oh Im so excited I mean apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that Im keeping score or anything... five!
 Ross:Well ok its for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it Ill finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the Paleontology Review! Yeah! Thatll be the first time my name is in there without people raising serious questions about my work!
 Ross:Yeah. Why?
 Ross:Your ex-boyfriend?
 Ross:So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow your new boyfriend is screwed!
 Ross:Well if you think it would help.
 Ross:Ok now is there anything I can do to... you know butter him up? Anything he really likes?
 Ross:Well see how dinner goes.
 Ross:I cant believe Im about to meet Benjamin Hobart. Ive always thought of him as one of the people Id invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think theres any chance hell bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
 Ross:Well I... I am having a good hair day.
 Ross:Im ok.
 Ross:Its an honor to meet you. I cant tell you how long Ive been an admirer of your work I mean that Nobel prize (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean I have to tell you that youre one of the reasons I got into the field.
 Ross:No but its you know its just a funny image you know the two of you in this restaurant with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz mmm.
 Ross:Ok well I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
 Ross:See there are still several areas that havent been fully excavated.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Did you just say break up with Charlie?
 Ross:Kind of inappropriate dont you think?
 Ross:Are you serious?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:(Rolls his eyes) I guess!
 Ross:(shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say Whats wrong? Answer the question)
 Ross:(annoyed) May 12th?
 Ross:(even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
 Ross:Wha...? Wait wait wait just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
 Ross:(annoyed) um... Ive never heard of a Boscodictiasaur.
 Ross:(stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly) B - O - S ...
 Ross:Oh come on!!
 Ross:Oh hi! Hello! Uh have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmothers nickname perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margarets pants size?
 Ross:(Sarcastic) No! Stop!
 Ross:(Skeptical) Really?
 Ross:I have to break up with Charlie?
 Ross:Youre crazy.
 Ross:Crazy!
 Ross:(Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
 Ross:Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
 Ross:No I didnt and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
 Ross:Yeah. He wouldnt give me the grant because I wouldnt give you up.
 Ross:Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review who was the voice of Underdog?
 Ross:If you dont believe me lets go talk to him okay? Im telling you he didnt ask me one paleontological question.
 Ross:Oh Im sorry no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
 Ross:Damnit!
 Ross:I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! Thats the voice of Underdog!
 Ross:No no no. Dont do that! I want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth.
 Ross:Too little too late Benji!
 Ross:(indignant) No!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:or...
 Ross:Sweetie this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
 Ross:Okay thats it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
 Ross:Hey you guys!
 Ross:Hey what are you doing?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Theres no way around it Pheebs you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
 Ross:Yeah and Im responsible for just like half of that.
 Ross:Ive got to say you guys thats an incredible gesture!
 Ross:No no no. The next time its gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!
 Ross:(he enters) Hi!
 Ross:Oh good!
 Ross:Oh thats OK. Im sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
 Ross:There was one! Shes it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
 Ross:Well I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
 Ross:Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
 Ross:Be-caaauuuse...
 Ross:Seriously?
 Ross:(sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder whos gonna play you in the movie!
 Ross:Look Im sorry to hear about your tragedy ok? But the swings are perfectly safe and besides Emma loves them. You know what you should come with us and youll see!
 Ross:Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look please just come on you know when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face I swear you won’t regret it.
 Ross:Good you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children do you?
 Ross:Oh yeah that’s the same I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:Rach she’s got like three hairs!
 Ross:I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
 Ross:Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)
 Ross:See I told you!
 Ross:Oh absolutely!
 Ross:Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared of swings I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!

 Ross:No! No no no no okay it wasnt the swings fault. It was my fault and kind 
 Ross:No wait okay okay I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing okay? And 
 Ross:Look I just think youre an adult okay? And you should get over your silly 
 Ross:Good.
 Ross:(He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
 Ross:I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again 
 Ross:(nervously) Ok...
 Ross:(Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok get on the swing!
 Ross:See?
 Ross:There you go! Good for you! And you know what Im actually getting used to this little guy. I dont really even feel him in here anymore.
 Ross:Well... (realizes screaming like a little girl trying to get rid of the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
 Ross:Are you kidding?
 Ross:(skeptical) That doesnt sound like you... Thats Monica talking!
 Ross:Shes putting words in your mouth!
 Ross:Hey! Hey guess what Joey has!

 Ross:Did I do something to you?

 Ross:Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachels hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling New York Division.
 Ross:You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
 Ross:I cant believe this shes our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
 Ross:So this is an annual thing?
 Ross:Yeah. What are we gonna do?
 Ross:Ooh well say that we were mugged! You cant get mad at someone whos been mugged!
 Ross:(to Joey) HEY!
 Ross:I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
 Ross:(sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
 Ross:(Reading the note) We know youre out there. (Rachel gasps)
 Ross:Well lets just go in there and face them.
 Ross:What is that?
 Ross:Wha...? Oh sure now they lock it but when theyre having sex on the couch its like Come on in my butt is surprisingly hairy.
 Ross:Come on you guys were sorry alri...? Our subway broke down.
 Ross:(to Joey who is wearing a blue 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
 Ross:How are we gonna decide who gets this?
 Ross:Thats worse than no food.
 Ross:I dont know...
 Ross:(Staring back and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah he can do it!
 Ross:I feel terrible.
 Ross:Really girls not cool.
 Ross:Its a day to be thankful.

 Ross:Im just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Come on shes gonna love you guys!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Hey you guys I need some fashion advice.

 Ross:Cmon! This looks good!
 Ross:Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
 Ross:Really? That would be great. I mean I have to do something she kinda teased me about how I dress.
 Ross:Youre wearing the same shirt.
 Ross:You know we should just go I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
 Ross:Rach come on I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).
 Ross:(feeling the fabric) Wow this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?
 Ross:Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys?
 Ross:All right that’s it I’m getting out of here.
 Ross:Uh actually these might look pretty good on me.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:So you’re saying uh if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
 Ross:(to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
 Ross:(not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? Im glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
 Ross:Oh I see somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
 Ross:Youre just jealous because you couldnt pull this off. Yeah now if youll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!
 Ross:Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and Im so glad were finally doing this.
 Ross:Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)
 Ross:Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
 Ross:Because its soft... Hey so how was your date?
 Ross:Well looks like its just the two of us tonight huh old buddy?
 Ross:(mortified) Hi.
 Ross:I just feel like someone reached down my throat grabbed my small intestine pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...

 Ross:Ill be fine alright? Really everyone. I hope shell be very happy.

 Ross:A wandering?
 Ross:So Rachel whatre you uh... whatre you up to tonight?
 Ross:Right youre not even getting your honeymoon God.. No no although Aruba this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway if you dont feel like being alone tonight Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
 Ross:Okay sure.
 Ross:(squatting and reading the instructions) Im supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
 Ross:(clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carols favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can I should have known.
 Ross:You guys.
 Ross:Im divorced!  Im only 26 and Im divorced!
 Ross:That only took me an hour.
 Ross:You know what the scariest part is? What if theres only one woman for everybody yknow? I mean what if you get one woman- and thats it? Unfortunately in my case there was only one woman- for her...
 Ross:I honestly dont know if Im hungry or horny.
 Ross:(scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long its been since Ive grabbed a spoon? Do the words Billy dont be a hero mean anything to you?
 Ross:Yknow heres the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)
 Ross:I assume were looking for an answer more sophisticated than to get you into bed.
 Ross:You got a job?
 Ross:The word youre looking for is Anyway...
 Ross:Come on you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
 Ross:Cmon cut. Cut cut cut...
 Ross:No. No I gotta go home sometime.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh no-
 Ross:No no no go-
 Ross:Split it?
 Ross:Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didnt know this but back in high school I had a um major crush on you.
 Ross:You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monicas geeky older brother.
 Ross:Oh. Listen do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
 Ross:Okay... okay maybe I will...
 Ross:Goodnight.
 Ross:I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
 Ross:Theres an image.
 Ross:Food.
 Ross:Oh my God. Its like Sophies Choice.
 Ross:I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
 Ross:I know and with the baby coming?
 Ross:I don’t know. Phoebe if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
 Ross:No one I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
 Ross:(yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy it was hypothetical!
 Ross:Believe me if I did see with someone there’s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)
 Ross:We think Chandler might be having an affair.
 Ross:Whats going on?
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:(sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50s?
 Ross:You know what if you wanna look for a house thats okay.
 Ross:(to Joey) Its ok because they have to get it out of their system okay (back to Mon and Chan) but youre going to realize this is the only place you wanna be.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:You put an offer on a house?
 Ross:Yeah I mean if you moved there you have to leave here. I mean how can you leave this place?
 Ross:You can see where hed have trouble.
 Ross:That money is mine Green!
 Ross:What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
 Ross:Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…

 Ross:Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
 Ross:Two seconds...
 Ross:11 unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.)
 Ross:(to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
 Ross:No 19.
 Ross:Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
 Ross:Correct his profession was?
 Ross:Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
 Ross:10 seconds you need this or you lose the game.
 Ross:Don’t blame the questions!
 Ross:Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
 Ross:What the hell are doing?!!
 Ross:(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
 Ross:(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)
 Ross:And hey heres to a lousy Christmas.
 Ross:You know sometimes when Im alone in my apartment I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs the Yangs? They dont make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)
 Ross:Yeah. Im sorry too. Im even more sorry that that phone call didnt come before I told you about looking through the window.
 Ross:Love you guys. (he kisses Monica he Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
 Ross:I love this. (he got a sweater)
 Ross:Seriously you guys whats going on? What are these for?
 Ross:Really? Which one?
 Ross:Things you find in the ocean (to Joey) Youre gonna be on Pyramid!!
 Ross:Except for Match game...
 Ross:Oh and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I cant believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
 Ross:(very excited) Yeah-uh!
 Ross:(singing) ...and Im a little bit rock n roll!
 Ross:So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God look theres Geoffrey Cleric.
 Ross:He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
 Ross:Hey theres Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
 Ross:Dude. Youre married to my sister.
 Ross:Hey I hear shes single again dyou think I should ask her out?
 Ross:Yes please.

 Ross:Hey Missy...
 Ross:Yeah yeah. You should come check us out. Were called Way! No Way!.
 Ross:Boss!
 Ross:Shes gone.
 Ross:Dude I was gonna ask her out.
 Ross:Well I thought it first Holmes.
 Ross:Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean we can get laid anytime we want.
 Ross:Me too. Im good at it.
 Ross:You got it.
 Ross:Those are the pacts!
 Ross:Oh oh... maybe not you!
 Ross:Thank you. (they shake hands) All right here I go. Hey remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
 Ross:I know and I cant stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)
 Ross:So Saturday night!
 Ross:Great!
 Ross:Oh well uh this is gonna sound kinda silly but do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
 Ross:Its been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
 Ross:Thats ok. Uh anyway well he and I both really liked you a lot uhm but we didnt want anything to jeopardize our friendship so we kinda made a pact that neither of us could ask you out!
 Ross:Yeah why?
 Ross:You did?
 Ross:(angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
 Ross:(To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that after you promised me?
 Ross:You broke the pact!
 Ross:That doesnt matter! Were talking about the foundation of our friendship.
 Ross:I didnt.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:NO!
 Ross:I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
 Ross:I dont know what... youre talking about.
 Ross:Listen Adrienne you cant tell Chandler about this.
 Ross:Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
 Ross:I didnt know you knew about that.
 Ross:(looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... Im sorry.
 Ross:So eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess were even.
 Ross:We are even right?
 Ross:(thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?
 Ross:Hey wheres Rachel?
 Ross:Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
 Ross:Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
 Ross:Well it matters to me.
 Ross:Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
 Ross:Okay after you told me she was passed out in our room I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed all buried in peoples coats. Well I went to kiss her on the forehead you know. But it was so dark I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second but... it was amazing. And now now I find out that you kissed her first.
 Ross:Mine.
 Ross:No she was definitely on my bed.
 Ross:Well then who was on my bed?
 Ross:(realizing) NO! No no!
 Ross:You were under the pile of coats?
 Ross:OH MY GOD!
 Ross:You were my first kiss with Rachel?
 Ross:Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)
 Ross:Oh (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
 Ross:That is why!
 Ross:Yeah I thought wed be groomsmen but wouldnt they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
 Ross:I wanna say its not looking good.
 Ross:What? (Ross and Chandler dont know what to say so theres an embarrassing long pause)
 Ross:Oh man!
 Ross:FOOTBALL!
 Ross:I cant believe were gonna be the only people that arent in this wedding.
 Ross:And its a wedding! Itd be weird if Im not in it...
 Ross:Who cares AND?
 Ross:Ill do it!
 Ross:No Mike no no. You wanna pick me I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?
 Ross:(to Chandler) Well if Phoebes choosing then say hello to Mikes next groomsman.
 Ross:Please youre going down!
 Ross:Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
 Ross:So what did you decide?
 Ross:Ill do it! (Monica approaches)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Wheres Rach?
 Ross:I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation ok? Im not gonna watch Chandler up there while Im sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachels room knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! Youre breathtaking!
 Ross:You havent by any chance chosen a groomsman yet have you?
 Ross:Im not! Im making it easier! Pick me!
 Ross:Listen listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now I promise I wont say a word but if you pick Chandler hes gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
 Ross:(waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES YES!
 Ross:(smiling to himself) Good. Im just getting some coffee. So Im alert for the wedding.
 Ross:(barely containing himself at this point) Well you have fun tonight.
 Ross:Oh I will.
 Ross:Wait a minute I know why Im being such an ass why are you?
 Ross:Im not supposed to tell you!
 Ross:Rachel only one of us can do it you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)
 Ross:What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
 Ross:(to Rachel) Haha! Looks like youre not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs.
 Ross:(To Phoebe and Mike) I cant believe you guys arent going to be able to get married today.
 Ross:No but Chandler hello... Arent you scared of dogs?
 Ross:(takes Chappy from Mike) Well I guess Im in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!
 Ross:Uhm ministers dont ride the subway for free.
 Ross:Ill...
 Ross:Its the dog.
 Ross:Uh Joey...
 Ross:Chappys heart rate has slowed way down.
 Ross:Come on Chappy do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
 Ross:Joey you shouldnt lie on your résumé.
 Ross:(whispering) It was ok...
 Ross:(he enters) Hey.
 Ross:You guys know where Rachel is?
 Ross:So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What? Shes gonna eat all those cookies?
 Ross:So why is Erica coming to visit?
 Ross:(looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
 Ross:No no no Im sure you have a great excuse wh-was it a hair appointment a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barneys?
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:Is-is he ok?
 Ross:Ok ok. Im gonna come out to Long Island with you I mean you cant be alone right now.
 Ross:Still-still let me come... for me.
 Ross:I bet someone could use one of Monicas freshly baked cookies.
 Ross:Oh!
 Ross:And Im Doctor Ross Geller.
 Ross:Rach I think Im gonna wait out here because my throat is feeling a little scratchy I dont want to infect him.
 Ross:Im not scared of him Im really sick!
 Ross:Im feeling better.
 Ross:Hes unconscious I think well be just fine!
 Ross:Did the TV wake you?
 Ross:Ouchy.
 Ross:Well I came with Rachel who should be back any second! (pause) So whats new?
 Ross:Right is it painful?
 Ross:Nope just the one. RACH!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dads fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
 Ross:Oh yeah. Emmas doing great.
 Ross:Wow.
 Ross:Just cant believe Im in Rachel Greens room.
 Ross:Yeah sure right! Like Ive ever been in Rachel Greens room.
 Ross:Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?
 Ross:You had a rough day uh?
 Ross:But we do! (pause) Its gonna be ok Rach!
 Ross:What? No no! Hey hey hey look...
 Ross:They gave him a lot of medication ok? He wouldnt even know if you were there. Look well go see him first thing in the morning ok?
 Ross:No God! Hey Rach youve been an amazing daughter ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
 Ross:(he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.
 Ross:Sure!
 Ross:Oh of course...
 Ross:Me too. Come here. (They hug)
 Ross:Ok well uh I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or...(Theres one of those moments. Theyre staring at each other no word uttered and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No Rach! Im sorry I just dont think this this this is a good idea.
 Ross:No look uh. You are upset about your father and youre feeling vulnerable and I just dont feel it would be right Id feel like Id be you know taking advantage of you.
 Ross:Look Im sure it would be great but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly so Im gonna go!
 Ross:Ill see you in the morning (he leaves).
 Ross:(outside her room talking by himself) Havent had sex in four months I should get a medal for that!
 Ross:Hey Rach can you grab me a cup of coffee?
 Ross:Youve been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
 Ross:You sure youre alright?
 Ross:(knowing shes not alright) O-kay. Well Im gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)
 Ross:(knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
 Ross:(half amused) Wait wait (looks around a little) Youre mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
 Ross:(acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...
 Ross:I cant believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
 Ross:Hey I was looking out for you.
 Ross:I gotta say I have not had sex a lot of times before this is the worst ever.
 Ross:Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future lets just say you and me never having sex again.
 Ross:Thats right sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green are you feeling better? (Rachels dad glares at him with a deadly look)
 Ross:Emmas down for the night.
 Ross:So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
 Ross:Oh no problem.
 Ross:Thank you. Im glad you agree.
 Ross:Yeah... Yeah thats true.
 Ross:Oh ye-ah!

 Ross:I got tenure. I didnt win the lottery... Hey Rach so uh... how did your thing go?
 Ross:Oh you know what? Youre gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
 Ross:And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
 Ross:But also knowing it means a lot.
 Ross:...that center around work.
 Ross:You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
 Ross:No seriously. I have job security for life. You know I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
 Ross:Rach Im so sorry.
 Ross:Great. I feel like an idiot.
 Ross:Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.
 Ross:(stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic) Im sorry its almost as if this wasnt built for a quick getaway!
 Ross:Uh you know you cant always get a seat on the subway so... (laughs stupidly)
 Ross:Yeah! yeah I got tenure! (Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
 Ross:See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. Ive met him before?
 Ross:(realizing) That is Mark?
 Ross:I hate that guy.
 Ross:No no NO you cannot go to dinner with him.
 Ross:Oh yeah Im sure hes gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
 Ross:Im serious. I just dont trust that guy okay?
 Ross:Hey is Rachel here?
 Ross:Shes still at dinner?
 Ross:That guy Mark. From Bloomingdales... She thinks hes just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
 Ross:We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
 Ross:Hey so uhm... How was dinner?
 Ross:(speaking without pause agitated) Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
 Ross:Should we send something?
 Ross:Congratulations!
 Ross:Can we can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along huh? You didnt believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
 Ross:(gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
 Ross:So if you take this job youll be moving to Paris?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:All right well work it out.
 Ross:Yeah yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
 Ross:Well Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
 Ross:Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back she would take it?
 Ross:I dont know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
 Ross:I didnt say we were brothers.
 Ross:Yeah Im a friend of Rachel Greens. Uhm actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
 Ross:Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
 Ross:Uhm well... Im here to see if youll give Rachel her job back.
 Ross:Oh no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then well see if she wants to come back.
 Ross:Look she loved her job here. And lets face it youre not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isnt that true?
 Ross:(surprised) Huh I took a shot there.
 Ross:I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.) Is this your son?
 Ross:Oh nothing it’s just it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
 Ross:How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left just the two of us and he can touch anything he wants. (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
 Ross:You let Rachel come back and it’s done.
 Ross:Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear your kid is going to have the time of his life.
 Ross:He’ll be fine.
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:Nooo!
 Ross:So you’re not going to Paris.
 Ross:Wh… wh…what?
 Ross:Yeeeah! (They high-five)
 Ross:(enters) Its me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed) Look I um I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
 Ross:Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks hopeful)
 Ross:Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
 Ross:Huh? So? We have a deal?
 Ross:Yes! yes!
 Ross:Oh (grins) Believe me the ladies they love it!
 Ross:Good cause the ladies not so much. (shakes his head give him a thumbs up and leaves)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:They did?
 Ross:So what are you gonna do?
 Ross:Thats great! So youre staying in New York!
 Ross:Youre excited right?
 Ross:Right!
 Ross:Uhm I hadnt no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm I mean you said you were scared.
 Ross:(after a long pause) You should go.
 Ross:Its what you want. You should go.
 Ross:I really do.
 Ross:(picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) Im sure hell understand.
 Ross:Yeah...
 Ross:Yeah yeah oh! (They hug)
 Ross:Then Im happy too. (Theyre still hugging - fade out)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey Erica welcome back to town! (pause) Wow look how big youve gotten.
 Ross:Right no I understand.
 Ross:No no I knew (he stares at her breasts).
 Ross:She brought them up! (pause) I didnt realize you were coming back so soon!
 Ross:Hotel? Why isnt she staying with you guys?
 Ross:Erica those things arent free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
 Ross:Oh man I cant believe you guys are leaving this place.
 Ross:No no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
 Ross:Hey is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
 Ross:Mhm (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
 Ross:What are you guys doing?
 Ross:You got it! (Monica leaves Ross closes the door). All right shes right we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Lets put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
 Ross:Chandler you dont have a sister so you cant understand how much this bums me out.
 Ross:Bumming hard guys bumming hard.
 Ross:Yeah? Yeah where is it?
 Ross:Rock on!
 Ross:Hey wheres Rach?
 Ross:Great.
 Ross:Here she is!
 Ross:Oh man! I cant believe shes actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Hey what do you think theyre doing in there?
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?
 Ross:Are you kidding? Oh my God...
 Ross:Oh man Im not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
 Ross:(to Joey) Oh no she took down Monica... And Im the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she wont talk with me if it looks like were deep in converstation. Oh so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
 Ross:Well its okay. Chandler is talking to her.
 Ross:I dont think so.
 Ross:God! I cant believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long?
 Ross:Okay here we go...
 Ross:Yeah...
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:What? I dont get a goodbye?
 Ross:Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
 Ross:Well it needs to be plicit.
 Ross:No I dont think so.
 Ross:(annoyed) O-kay... I mean dont I deserve anything? I mean a few tears a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)
 Ross:THE HELL I DO!
 Ross:I dont get a goodbye?
 Ross:(talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye huh? Be best friends with you? Uh go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute wait a minute I did all those things.
 Ross:Oh no maybe its me Im just not giving you enough credit. Uh I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye good... (makes choking noises) ITS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all weve been through I cant believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)
 Ross:Thats what it seemed like.
 Ross:Fine then why didnt you say something?
 Ross:Rach!
 Ross:You keep you keep... You cant...
 Ross:Rach!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Oh. This was amazing.
 Ross:Yeah well this guy at work gave me Sex for Dummies as a joke.
 Ross:Whos laughing now?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh my God!
 Ross:Phoebe you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
 Ross:Is Rachel here?
 Ross:Uh we yknow we worked things out.
 Ross:Hey Im not one to kiss and tell but Im also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
 Ross:I know its pretty great.
 Ross:Oh I.. I dont know. We didnt really get to talk.
 Ross:I dont know. It was incredible. I mean it just felt so right. When I was holding her I mean I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah I do. I wanna be together.
 Ross:Shhh!
 Ross:Wow I hadnt thought of that. I hope not.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Hey. How did you sleep?
 Ross:Good.
 Ross:Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
 Ross:So...
 Ross:Morning.
 Ross:It really was.
 Ross:I know me too. It was... You know it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen and then it does and its everything you want it to be.
 Ross:And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
 Ross:Nothing! What do you say to that?
 Ross:No way!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:You really think so?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Alright you know what? Youre right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
 Ross:What? What?
 Ross:Oh my God!
 Ross:Im not getting you a muffin!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:No and Im not going to.
 Ross:Because shes just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
 Ross:Yeah and she still wants to go! Its pretty clear where she is.
 Ross:Look even if I were gonna tell her I dont have to do it now. Okay? Ill be seeing her again. Weve got time.
 Ross:Oh my God! You did that yourself?

 Ross:Okay guys wish me luck.

 Ross:Oh my God Phoebe slow down!
 Ross:Yes but I dont wanna die in your cab!

 Ross:Little louder okay I think theres a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didnt quite hear you...
 Ross:My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part)
 Ross:It was my first time.

 Ross:Me. Was that not clear? Hey why dont um why dont I just join you both here?
 Ross:Yes I do have a laundry room in my building um but theres a.... rat problem. Apparently theyre attracted to the dryer sheets and theyre goin in fine but theyre comin out all.... fluffy. Anyway say sevenish?
 Ross:(on phone) Ok bye. (hangs up) Well Monicas not coming its just gonna be me and Rachel.
 Ross:Its laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
 Ross:Nuh-uh.
 Ross:So whatre you saying here? I should shave again pick up some wine what?
 Ross:(sheepish) No.
 Ross:Ok ok now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What it says Im a sensitive warm kinda guy you know like a warm fuzzy bear. Ok I can pick something else up on the way.
 Ross:Whats goin on?
 Ross:Was your basket on top?
 Ross:So?
 Ross:No suds? Excuse me hold on a second. (to woman) Thats my friends machine.
 Ross:Hey hey hey thats not the rule and you know it.
 Ross:(to the crowd in the laundromat) All right shows over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok lets do laundry.
 Ross:Well thats because youre such a sweet gentle uh...Do you uh do you...Oh hey uh you must need detergent.
 Ross:Uberveiss. Its new its German its extra-tough.
 Ross:Rach do you uh are you gonna separate those?
 Ross:Rach have you never done this before?
 Ross:Uh well dont worry Ill use the gentle cycle. Ok um basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites a whole nother machine for colors and a third for your uh your uh delicates and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
 Ross:(visibly nervous) Uh that that that would be a judgment call.
 Ross:That does not sound stupid to me. You know its like the first time I had to make dinner for myself after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) Im sorry thats all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
 Ross:(not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh uh-oh the laundrys done. Its uh its a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundrys done uh-oh uh-oh.
 Ross:Nothing nothing. Lee-lo the laundrys done.
 Ross:All right all right its just that you left a red sock in with all your whites and now everythings kinda pink.
 Ross:Yeah uh except for the red sock which is still red. Im sorry please dont be upset it could happen to anyone.
 Ross:You got the clothes clean. Now thats the important part.
 Ross:You were incredible! Brand new woman ladies and gentlemen.

 Ross:He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
 Ross:Cmon! Cmon!
 Ross:No of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah yeah it is.
 Ross:Well yknow monogamy can be a uh tricky concept. I mean anthropologically speaking-
 Ross:Fine. Fine alright now youll never know.
 Ross:Alright. Theres a theory put forth by Richard Leakey-
 Ross:Oh yeah nobody knows. And were not supposed to ask.
 Ross:Oh cmon! When we were kids yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasnt raggedy!
 Ross:Alright you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives but you dont pay it right away.
 Ross:Because youre a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
 Ross:Monica? Youre Mom.
 Ross:Cmon seriously Joey whats the part?
 Ross:Youre right youre right it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
 Ross:Look at it this way you dumped her. Right? I mean this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful intelligent unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?

 Ross:Step back.
 Ross:Well it was the only thing to do there that didnt have a line.
 Ross:Come on.
 Ross:(sarcastically) And you didnt marry him because...?
 Ross:Probably. But you know Ill tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
 Ross:It is. Eventually it kind of... burns out. But hopefully what youre left with is trust and security and... well in the case of my ex-wife lesbianism. So you know for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing theres all that other good stuff.
 Ross:But um... I dont think thats going to be you.
 Ross:Uh-uh. See I see.... big passion in your future.
 Ross:Mmmm.
 Ross:I do.
 Ross:(innocently) What?
 Ross:(acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
 Ross:No no no. Im not in the zone.

 Ross:I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean there were characters plot lines themes a motif... at one point there were villagers.
 Ross:Well ahem... you know by the time wed finished with all the dirty talk it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted so uh...
 Ross:Yeah which was nice.
 Ross:I don’t know whether he’s testing me or just acting out but my monkey is out of control. But he keeps erasing the messages on my machine supposedly by accident.
 Ross:And then like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and peed all over the crossword.
 Ross:Oh Pheebs I’m sorry I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.
 Ross:No Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads we’ve got lesbians the whole parenting team.

 Ross:(Angry) I- I- I ca- I cant believe this. I mean all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
 Ross:No yknow what I guess its partially my fault. Yknow I shouldntve uh asked you to start off with a monkey. I shouldve started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
 Ross:You called Animal Control?
 Ross:Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. Im not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him theyll take him away from me.
 Ross:Thats right I.. cause I didnt expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
 Ross:Yeah we thought we had a monkey but we-we didnt.
 Ross:Cat!
 Ross:My uncle Marcel.
 Ross:Marcel?
 Ross:Marc- oh this is ridiculous! Weve been all over the neighbourhood. Hes gone hes-hes just gone.

 Ross:Yeah yeah. Yknow now that you kicked the sign hey! I dont miss Marcel any more!
 Ross:Oh no no no. Nono this is just vintage Rachel. I mean things just sort of happen around you. I mean youre off in Rachel-land doing your Rachel-thing totally oblivious to peoples monkeys or to peoples feelings...

 Ross:(To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school you couldntve been fat.
 Ross:Itll be nice to get this off finally wont it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now thats fine.
 Ross:Listen Im- Im sorry I was so hard on you before its just I...
 Ross:Yeah but you were the one who got him back yknow? You you were great. ...Hey we uh we still have that uh that bottle of wine. You in the mood for uh something grape?
 Ross:Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The uh the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well so long as were here and uh not on the subject I was thinking about uh how mad we got at each other before and um I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we um...
 Ross:We have got to start locking that door!
 Ross:I dont know you dont wanna mess with corn nuts. Theyre craaazy.
 Ross:I cant believe it! Hes looking right at us!
 Ross:Okay okay whats going on?

 Ross:Four letters Circle or hoop.
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:Heating device.
 Ross:Five letters.
 Ross:I just wanna clarify this are you outing Mr. Peanut?
 Ross:Second date!
 Ross:I think when someone steals your credit card theyve kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
 Ross:Marcel stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachels room) come here Marcel-
 Ross:What? Its its just a phase.
 Ross:Would you all relax? Its not that big a deal.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(Mortified) Hi.
 Ross:At the vet.
 Ross:She says Marcels humping things not a phase. Apparently hes reached sexual maturity.
 Ross:She says as time goes on hes gonna start getting agressive and violent.
 Ross:Im gonna have to give him up.
 Ross:I know. I know. I mean one day hes this little thing and before you know it hes this little thing I cant get off my leg.
 Ross:No no. The vet says unless hes in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin hes just gonna get vicious. Ive just gotta get him into a zoo.
 Ross:Well were applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos yknow like uh San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream because yknow hes out of state. Uh my vet uh knows someone at Miami so thats a possibility.
 Ross:What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. Shes a stealer.
 Ross:Yeah which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
 Ross:(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didnt get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I dont know who this is harder on me or him.
 Ross:Marcel! Marcel! Marcel no! Good boy. See how can nobody want him?
 Ross:Where exactly is your zoo?
 Ross:Yes.
 Ross:No-no hes hes very docile.
 Ross:Well I I dont know. Why?
 Ross:He can hold a banana if thats whatcha mean...
 Ross:Why- why- why would he need a blade?
 Ross:Hes in! Oh did you hear that Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
 Ross:Aww. Thank you Aunt Phoebe.
 Ross:Just just say what you feel.
 Ross:That was good.
 Ross:Uh if you guys dont mind Id like to take a moment just me and him.
 Ross:Marcel cmere cmere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy this is it. Theres just a coupla things I want to say. Im really gonna miss you and Im never gonna forget about you. Youve been more than just a pet to me youve been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay Marcel please could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel would- okay just take him away. Just take him.
 Ross:Why why why would you dream that?
 Ross:I love it when we share.
 Ross:I cant belive you two had sex in her dream.
 Ross:Pheebs why would you want to operate a drill press?
 Ross:Oh its my new beeper.
 Ross:No its for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.

 Ross:Huh!
 Ross:Are you not seeing him anymore?
 Ross:Oh yeah.
 Ross:Its morphin time!
 Ross:Oh Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911 it means shes having a baby otherwise I just ignore it.
 Ross:Oh well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan and frankly it was a little more than I needed to know.
 Ross:I thought that was just a rumour.

 Ross:Well then I think I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
 Ross:You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing and adorable and sexy you are you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking Oh my god Im with Rachel. You know someone who makes you feel good the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer but hearing that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?

 Ross:I did not freak out.
 Ross:Because its breast milk. Its gross.
 Ross:No no Carol. Theres nothing wrong with it. I just I just dont think breast milk is for adults.

 Ross:Well yeah kinda. Um but that’s okay see we have an understanding um see we each have this list of five famous people (gets his out) so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No no no it’s flattery.
 Ross:Oh no no no wait wait Isabella. Don’t don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
 Ross:Um yeah.
 Ross:Um no.
 Ross:But okay.
 Ross:Um see but that’s not the final draft.
 Ross:Yeah um okay see you were you were on the list but my friend Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international so I bumped you for Wynona Rider local.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.
 Ross:I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
 Ross:Yeah I’ll take some.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Hey yknow while we’re on that when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
 Ross:Phoebe she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:So how many more do you have tomorrow?
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Sure your dresser is missing but this she notices.
 Ross:I have to go. Yeah Carol should be home by now soo...
 Ross:Oh better actually. Yknow I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
 Ross:Yeah yknow how I have you guys well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers but last week she meet this woman at the gym Susan something and they really hit it off and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference
 Ross:No real- honey really it’s fine just g-go with Susan. Really I no I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay okay bye
 Ross:I don’t know something girlie.
 Ross:(all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
 Ross:My marriage I think my marriage is um is kinda over.
 Ross:‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.
 Ross:(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink many drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d she’d see some beautiful woman and and she’d be Ross yknow look at her and I’d think God my wife is cool!
 Ross:Well now I do!!
 Ross:Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....
 Ross:Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing or I’d paid more attention or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
 Ross:Wait wait wait wait wait.
 Ross:Wait wait wait.
 Ross:My foot is stuck in the pocket.
 Ross:No I can’t get it out.
 Ross:No come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!
 Ross:Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
 Ross:Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
 Ross:Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
 Ross:My wife’s a lesbian.
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:So I told Carl ‘Nobody no matter how famous their parents are nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....

 Ross:It’s not a library...
 Ross:So Dr. Green how’s the old boat.
 Ross:It gives it a nice antiquey look.
 Ross:Wow. I’m sorry when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that)
 Ross:Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
 Ross:Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
 Ross:That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.
 Ross:So?

 Ross:Yes that’s what I was going to ask thank you.
 Ross:You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths ‘Don’t worry I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’d be great no I just wanted to ask Monica because I know how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hmm?
 Ross:Joey Homo Sapiens are people.

 Ross:Whoa whoa whoa ho ho ho you did not win the game the touchdown didn’t count because of the spectacularly illegal oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
 Ross:Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?
 Ross:Yes it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said ‘nobody won that game ‘ and he was sick of our fighting so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.
 Ross:Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
 Ross:Can I see you for a second?
 Ross:All right we’re gonna play.

 Ross:Ah well it means that I can sell cookies but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.
 Ross:No please please um it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
 Ross:Okay okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)

 Ross:Wait a minute one box! Come on I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler what about you?
 Ross:No but ah there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what I’ll put you down for eight boxes one for each night.

 Ross:That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the salute)
 Ross:Hi there!
 Ross:Um that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.

 Ross:Oh come here sweetie listen you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposed to come out.
 Ross:That word was swans.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:I’m I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp and I’m hoping that maybe somehow this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!!

 Ross:All right look look you’ve got to do this yourself okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela okay when which ever one she is comes to the door you take her for a walk you let her down easy.

 Ross:Okay Jasmine please please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
 Ross:Thank you thank you.
 Ross:(angrily) Who’s your roommate?
 Ross:Gunther! Gunther. Gunther please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
 Ross:(forcing the door open) Come on Rachel come on! Talk to me! Please!!
 Ross:Rachel?
 Ross:No it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
 Ross:No!!
 Ross:No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:She was...
 Ross:She she was different.
 Ross:Nobody likes change.
 Ross:What? Okay okay okay okay.
 Ross:I’m sorry okay I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself and this morning I was so I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
 Ross:Listen. Oh hey hey the important thing was that she meant she meant nothing to me!
 Ross:Look I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
 Ross:That for all I knew would could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
 Ross:Look I’m not trying to get out of anything okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
 Ross:Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
 Ross:Look Rachel I wanted to tell you I thought I should I-I did and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
 Ross:Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?
 Ross:(pause) Yes I would.
 Ross:(less sure) Yes.
 Ross:(covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay okay yeah I would have been devastated but I would still want to be with you. Because it’s I mean it’s you.
 Ross:What? Come on Rach tell me what you’re thinking?
 Ross:Order a pizza like ‘I forgive you?’
 Ross:Hey can I can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.
 Ross:No anchovies.
 Ross:That’s okay I’ll just pick ‘em off.
 Ross:You can have the last piece if you want.
 Ross:What now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel I-I’m sorry okay I’m sorry I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right I that’s not me I’m not Joey!
 Ross:Yknow what yknow what I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that that break okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that that ran when things got just a little rough!
 Ross:That’s what?!
 Ross:Okay well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look I (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible stupid stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry I wish I could take it back but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel I love you so much.
 Ross:Okay okay okay.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(moving over to stand in front of her) Okay okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...
 Ross:Look look there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without without these arms and your face and this heart. Your good heart Rach (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and and....
 Ross:(crying) Yeah but this can’t be it I mean.
 Ross:Look you guys I just wanna say I really really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now so I just wanna say thanks.
 Ross:Oh hey hey huh how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh huh what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts it’ll be great!
 Ross:No no no this weekend guys!
 Ross:What’s going on?
 Ross:So for the whole weekend?
 Ross:Yeah that’s okay I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself yknow then I totally totally understand.

 Ross:Pity food? Yknow what that’s okay all right I don’t need any of you to stay okay nobody stays.
 Ross:(entering) Hey.
 Ross:Well oh just ah I was just wondering when you and I split up did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?

 Ross:Yeah well.
 Ross:Oh yeah I’d love that.
 Ross:I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)
 Ross:....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable yknow I mean they just took off took off without even looking back. Yknow I don’t I don’t need them huh I’ve got you guys now as friends you and Susan.
 Ross:(looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to return the page Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen but Ross grabs the last piece.) Hey you’ve have more of these for Susan right?
 Ross:Pheebs? What why are you whispering?
 Ross:Oh now you want a favour?
 Ross:Well oh I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
 Ross:No I’m not gonna pick them up.

 Ross:(to Rachel) Look both Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
 Ross:I can.
 Ross:Look you guys you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something but Ross cuts him off.) No I’m you you planned this all out and I don’t want to ruin it so you guys should just go.
 Ross:No no really I’ve got to take the car back anyway I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben It’s fine no guilt I promise.

 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:So they ah they all took off it was pretty hard watching them go yknow?
 Ross:(outside the door) So I’m gonna take off then!
 Ross:Pffhah.
 Ross:Nothing it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
 Ross:Hey that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
 Ross:Here you go.
 Ross:Sorry. (To remedy that Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)
 Ross:Exactly it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
 Ross:And so now you guys are gonna be married?
 Ross:Pheebs what is it the age thing?
 Ross:Pheebs if you don’t tell him soon he’s gonna be married and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
 Ross:All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.
 Ross:Yeah he-he’s right he’s right. This is your time yknow yeah you’re young you’re-you’re weird chicks dig that.
 Ross:No the man’s right that’s what I had with Rachel.

 Ross:Oh-oh okay okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff and relax in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening.

 Ross:Good night.
 Ross:Okey-dokey!
 Ross:Hey it’ll grow back right? And she-she’s really fun and she’s cool and-and I’m finally moving on. Yknow? I mean getting over Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound) yknow? Yknow and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there and-and I kiss her and Gooood I wanna kiss her and-and-and it doesn’t work out right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)
 Ross:(surprised) Hi!
 Ross:Awww.
 Ross:Yeah. (closes the door and goes over and kisses Rachel.)
 Ross:I know.
 Ross:(stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay I gotta go.
 Ross:Well I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
 Ross:Well yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.

 Ross:Whoa-oh okay! Yeah why am I telling you that?
 Ross:Yeah yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:It’s over.
 Ross:Well it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
 Ross:Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again but she turns away.)
 Ross:Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow it’s-it’s 530 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So I’d better get cracking on this baby.
 Ross:Okay I’ll be up in (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
 Ross:Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)
 Ross:Done!
 Ross:Well I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very very important to you to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully twice!
 Ross:I’m sorry.
 Ross:Does it? Does it? Yeah I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.
 Ross:(interrupting) No Rach no. I don’t I don’t I don’t have to think about it in fact I’ve decided I’ve decided that that it.......does.
 Ross:Oh sure! I’m sure.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What happened?
 Ross:It does. It really and truly does.
 Ross:(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
 Ross:She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
 Ross:Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault and she she says here (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”
 Ross:(calming down) Yeah I know. I mean no you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
 Ross:What the hell happened on that beach?!
 Ross:(coming back in with Rachel) Hey you guys! What do you what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
 Ross:What happened? Joey?
 Ross:Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
 Ross:I missed you too.
 Ross:(getting miffed) I suppose.
 Ross:(getting angry) Umm-hmm.
 Ross:(yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
 Ross:And for the record it took two people to break up this relationship!!
 Ross:I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
 Ross:I fell asleep!
 Ross:It was 530 in the morning and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room trapping Monica Chandler and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh and by the way Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
 Ross:(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
 Ross:Oh no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
 Ross:Who’s Chip?
 Ross:The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
 Ross:Monica you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in school!!
 Ross:(to Rachel) I was just leaving.
 Ross:Why? Did you write it?
 Ross:Well ah actually...
 Ross:Well umm why don’t you give him a call?
 Ross:Oh I’m sure.
 Ross:(whispering in her ear) Oh that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing!
 Ross:(reading the newspaper) Hey here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
 Ross:I’m reading your ad.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Good so do I
 Ross:Are you sure she’s in the cat or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
 Ross:So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
 Ross:So Pheebs how long is your mom gonna be with us?
 Ross:So guys am I crazy or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?
 Ross:Come on you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!
 Ross:No you don’t.
 Ross:No you do—yknow what you’re not gonna suck me into this.
 Ross:I do not always have to be—okay okay. (starts to leave)
 Ross:(taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.
 Ross:Yes we have to tell her!
 Ross:(holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay yknow what I have to go have dinner with my son can I trust that when you see Phoebe you will tell her.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:(entering) Hey! So ah what did the insurance company say?
 Ross:(seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay fine! Pheebs?
 Ross:Hi! Listen uhh this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
 Ross:No! No! Look—Hey enough is enough! Look I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
 Ross:None.
 Ross:I’m sorry.
 Ross:I don’t know what to say.
 Ross:(goes over to Julio) Come here here come here come here (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry about what I said umm it was it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit of my friend’s mother.
 Ross:Oh! Yknow I’ve got an extra futon.
 Ross:So why don’t you quit?
 Ross:Who is Maria?
 Ross:You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
 Ross:So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
 Ross:They make you take an oath?
 Ross:Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
 Ross:Whoa-whoa-whoa hey! Now remember what we talked about you gotta be strong.
 Ross:One more time Hey don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?
 Ross:Good! That’s good!
 Ross:Me? No.
 Ross:It’s okay man be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)
 Ross:No! And I’m not gonna be so you can save you little speech.
 Ross:And that’s funny why?
 Ross:Or! Or we could go to the bank close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
 Ross:And that’s not against your oath?!
 Ross:Hello.
 Ross:We’d like to close our accounts.
 Ross:No-no.
 Ross:No! And somehow we ended up with a joint checking account.
 Ross:So why don’t you quit?
 Ross:Who is Maria?
 Ross:You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?

 Ross:You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
 Ross:Well like that only instead of a chair its a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket its a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day its the end of time and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.
 Ross:What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
 Ross:No I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.

 Ross:Okay guys.

 Ross:(to Phoebe) Hey!
 Ross:Oh thanks thanks. So Monica tells me that uh you don’t want to play anymore because me and yknow my talent. Is that true?
 Ross:Pheebs…
 Ross:See but Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire and if it bothers you this much then I… I won’t play anymore.
 Ross:Yeah okay.
 Ross:Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:No the-the sad thing is if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her knowing Joey he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.
 Ross:Well I said-I said something to Phoebe.

 Ross:Thank you thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah I lost it. Y’know I’m not gonna play anymore (to Phoebe) would you can you finish my set?

 Ross:Hey-hey I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
 Ross:So listen ah I picked Monica for secret Santa but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah I was wondering if you wanna switch.
 Ross:Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice what are you gonna get me?
 Ross:Yeah well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
 Ross:Oh that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.
 Ross:Like uh that gold necklace I got her last year.
 Ross:Well she wore it all Christmas day and then uh…
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:What are you doing?
 Ross:Everything? Even the TV?
 Ross:Listen Joey I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?
 Ross:That’s a good point. So uh how long are you gonna punish him?
 Ross:You’ve sentenced him?!
 Ross:Joey the guy’s your best friend.
 Ross:Oh who? Me?
 Ross:Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
 Ross:I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
 Ross:He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hey yknow Mon if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son you’d be able to tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather.
 Ross:(to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
 Ross:I just wanna check something.
 Ross:(He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now we’ll see.
 Ross:(grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold this one is silver.
 Ross:Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
 Ross:What did you get?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Like ‘em like ‘em? Or I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?
 Ross:Sure! Oh and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
 Ross:There’s nothing the matter with me. See I’m not completely devoid of sentiment see I have feelings.
 Ross:I don’t know what to say I’m sorry. Though you’re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old we we actually we had people looking for that.
 Ross:He’s taking her purse!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:I’m sorry I’m late did I miss anything?
 Ross:15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles no!)
 Ross:Oh on a date. Yeah I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
 Ross:Okay it was just me and her at the back of the train and I sat near the door so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
 Ross:No I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great but she’s like totally great but she lives two and a half hours away.
 Ross:Oh wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
 Ross:You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
 Ross:Not her. Yeah this is someone else I meet and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie even though she’s a two hour train ride away is really pretty really smart and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl well she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s well she’s-she’s just as pretty I guess she’s smart she’s not fun.
 Ross:Well I-I want to give her another chance y’know? She lives so close. And at the end of the date the other time she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand if she wasn’t kidding she’s not fun she’s stupid and kind of a racist.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:I wasn’t sleeping.
 Ross:The one with the cat. I gotta go I’ve got another date.
 Ross:No it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.
 Ross:Y’know you’re right. Thank you.
 Ross:(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
 Ross:Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait so so you live in Montreal?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:I’m sorry I’m late did I miss anything?
 Ross:15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles no!)
 Ross:Oh on a date. Yeah I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
 Ross:Okay it was just me and her at the back of the train and I sat near the door so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.

 Ross:No it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.
 Ross:Y’know you’re right. Thank you.
 Ross:(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
 Ross:Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait so so you live in Montreal?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Uh actually Joey it’s the Cretasous period.
 Ross:My God!
 Ross:Pheebs you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot I mean morning sickness uhh labour and it’s all for somebody else!
 Ross:Well the stuff I just mentioned.
 Ross:That is really nice…lying! No way is that the reason!
 Ross:And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes.
 Ross:Yeah I was going for the metaphor.
 Ross:Just go for it Chandler.
 Ross:That’s okay I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later Joey. (Joey is shocked.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey uh I’m really really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
 Ross:But hey it’s not just me I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
 Ross:It’s like that everywhere Joey! Okay Mon back me up here. Where you work the uh waiters eat with the waiters right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs right?
 Ross:Thank you Dr. Phillips but I’m having my lunch at this table here in the middle. I’m having lunch right here with my good friend Joey if he’ll sit with me.
 Ross:Yknow we work in a museum of natural history and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now I look around this cafeteria and y’know what I see I see-I see division. Division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers and I ask myself My God why?! Now I say we shed these-these coats that separate us and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat and throws it down.) I’m Ross! I’m divorced and I have a kid!

 Ross:All right I’ll do it.
 Ross:Please hurry.
 Ross:When we first met her she was soaking her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes she was a totally different person.
 Ross:I’ve gotta go there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!
 Ross:Hey! You were so right!
 Ross:Uh what you said about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
 Ross:I mean I I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…

 Ross:But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!

 Ross:Look don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh I’ll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)

 Ross:(to Emily) Hey could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
 Ross:Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m dying. I really do.
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well okay I gotta have some more fun!
 Ross:(whines No.) That’s not true!
 Ross:What? No! No I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!
 Ross:I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!

 Ross:Yeah? I can use that trick hip no cup okay! Okay!
 Ross:But-but Liam’s on my team.

 Ross:Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet it’s in my pocket.
 Ross:No not you. (Emily gets it.)
 Ross:Oh I kinda was wasn’t I?
 Ross:I made a man twice my size cry. I mean I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.
 Ross:Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but I really am. And it’s all because of you wonderful amazing you.
 Ross:No no I’m serious. Thank you.
 Ross:It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what you know what? It’s not.
 Ross:Oh we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Bye. (They kiss.)
 Ross:Oh yeah she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days I don’t have to do it.
 Ross:Yeah she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together and that’s it. Y’know.
 Ross:Pheebs!
 Ross:(starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!
 Ross:Well as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean she’s going to come by first to say good-bye and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry no party.
 Ross:You really didn’t know?
 Ross:(interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
 Ross:Yeah but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know then The Plaza for dinner.
 Ross:No-no-no no umm actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually Surprise! And then Oh my God I’m so surprised—good-bye!
 Ross:Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)
 Ross:Yes we have something we have to get to.
 Ross:What big thing?
 Ross:(stopping them) Okay that-that’s enough! Y’know let’s let’s let someone else play.
 Ross:Okay we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
 Ross:That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned so…
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Helps a little.
 Ross:Yeah have a seat.
 Ross:That’s okay I mean it was just two-week thing anyway I just didn’t want it to end this way y’know?
 Ross:What do you mean?
 Ross:Yeah I really do. Yeah but what am I gonna do I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing y’know no commitment.
 Ross:You think?
 Ross:Hey you’re right.
 Ross:Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
 Ross:Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:So uh Emily just went to the airport.
 Ross:Eh her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know we-we said our good-byes this morning so…
 Ross:(Thinks about it.) Nah.
 Ross:Well I that’s the thing I don’t know! I mean whenever I brought it up with her she said (In a British accent.) This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…
 Ross:And why do you care so much?
 Ross:You had fantasies about Emily?
 Ross:Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
 Ross:Ahh.
 Ross:We said it was only going to be two weeks y’know?
 Ross:What-what is love really?
 Ross:I am a good kisser.
 Ross:Emily! (Runs up.)
 Ross:I just I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
 Ross:That’s that’s that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.
 Ross:(stops her) Wait uh listen. I-I I have to tell you something. Umm I’ve been thinking I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah I-I think I love you.
 Ross:That’s no problem.
 Ross:I did.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:She said Thank you. I said I love you. And she said Thank you.
 Ross:What do I do now?
 Ross:She already lives in London.
 Ross:Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call it is definitely over! No wait. Wait. Unless eventually I call her y’know just to she what’s going on and and she says she’ll call me back but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.
 Ross:(Answers the phone.) Hello?
 Ross:Emily hi! Uh how-how was you flight?
 Ross:No no that-that that’s all right. Umm I’m just glad you called.
 Ross:Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
 Ross:She doesn’t know which one of us she wants me or this Colin guy.
 Ross:Well…
 Ross:I’m not proving anything. Okay I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!
 Ross:No I missed and hit the door. But it opened really hard!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:I made fun of his accent.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:All right. All right I’m gonna do it!
 Ross:I’m gonna I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.
 Ross:(on phone) Hey.
 Ross:No because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
 Ross:About four hours.
 Ross:(yelling thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Ohh! Thank you.
 Ross:Hey if mommy can have a wife daddy can have a bra.
 Ross:Oh no-no-no see that-that clock’s a little fast uh we have 17 minutes. Huh what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
 Ross:Hey uh you can ignore that.
 Ross:Uhh believe me when he’s older he’ll understand.
 Ross:I’ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol Susan and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh Emily this is Carol and Susan.
 Ross:Look at you two bonding making us late for the airport so…
 Ross:Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:So uh Emily called last night…
 Ross:Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!
 Ross:Look this is just a little too familiar okay? For like for like six months before Carol and I spilt up all I heard was My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.
 Ross:Hey they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?
 Ross:How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
 Ross:What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.
 Ross:Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?
 Ross:Actually that-that’s not true in The Incredible Hulk uh No. 72 Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know ugh nevermind my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)
 Ross:(opening the door.) Hey!
 Ross:Well I asked him if he wanted to eat he said No. I asked him if he wanted to sleep he said No. I asked him what he wanted to do he said No. So he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)
 Ross:So umm any word from Susan?
 Ross:Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh by the by did it uh did it ever occur to you that I don’t know maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
 Ross:Y’know the kind of fun you and Susan had when we were married.
 Ross:Am I?!
 Ross:Am I?!
 Ross:Uh-huh Carol so were we. All right just-just imagine for a moment Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks they’re laughing y’know someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?
 Ross:OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!
 Ross:(returning from the phone.) So I just picked up a message from Emily she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
 Ross:So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!
 Ross:Oh wake up!
 Ross:Excuse me?
 Ross:Look I don’t know what you’re talking about I am not a crazy jealous person.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:It does not!
 Ross:This is not fun!
 Ross:Well I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
 Ross:Nice luggage.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Oh I missed you too.
 Ross:(To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
 Ross:Huh? I know I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around pretending like he’s jamming.)
 Ross:Uh I don’t know whatever.
 Ross:Oh I know. Y’know what I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy I love that guy! I mean I love you too a lot but that guy! I-I love that guy!
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London just one more day.
 Ross:One more day seriously/
 Ross:So then you can stay as long as you want.
 Ross:Oh no. Don’t don’t don’t start packing. Come on! (She puts some clothes into her bag and Ross throws them out.)
 Ross:Yeah I know I uh I tried them on.
 Ross:No. No I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.
 Ross:(entering) Hey guys! (They both notice his new little friend)
 Ross:Oh yeah Emily convinced me to do it.
 Ross:I like it and Emily likes it and that’s what counts. So uh how are you guys doing?
 Ross:Ugh she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.
 Ross:Yeah!! Yeah!
 Ross:I just I hate this so much! I mean every time I go pick her up at the airport it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking Well I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days dropping her off.
 Ross:Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean she lives there I live here. I mean she-she’d have to uh move here. She should move here!
 Ross:I could ask her to live with me!
 Ross:I mean why not! I mean I mean why not?!
 Ross:Look guys when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her y’know?
 Ross:I don’t want to do that.
 Ross:Yeah no you’re right I know you’re right I’m not I’m not gonna do it. All right thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:(laughs) Move in with me.
 Ross:Don’t be scared I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon but just-just think think how great it will be.
 Ross:I know.
 Ross:Well so you-you’ll get a job here! I mean I’m always hearing about uh them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
 Ross:No I can’t. I would I really would but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:No no don’t. Why don’t we?
 Ross:Get married.
 Ross:No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here ‘cause it’s us together forever and that’s-that’s what I want.
 Ross:Yeah I know so what? I mean who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look huh I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean this this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?

 Ross:Yeah right!
 Ross:That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
 Ross:Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
 Ross:My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
 Ross:(dialling the phone) All right-all right fine! I-I’m gonna call the cops!
 Ross:Not on you! On the stripper!
 Ross:Okay well we’ll call the company that sent her!
 Ross:So what Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well how could this happen?!
 Ross:Diverse.
 Ross:Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
 Ross:We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
 Ross:Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
 Ross:Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring kisses it and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)
 Ross:No that’s all right.
 Ross:Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man and I want both you guys.
 Ross:Hey both you guys should be up there with me. I mean you two are-are my… I mean I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting emotional.)

 Ross:Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh I can’t believe you’re not gonna be there!
 Ross:So-so come! Why don’t you come?

 Ross:Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?
 Ross:This is my wedding.
 Ross:Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.
 Ross:All right let’s go! Bye Pheebs!
 Ross:Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey okay?
 Ross:What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!
 Ross:Sweetie you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great okay? Come on. Come on.
 Ross:Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah. Yes this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.
 Ross:It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.
 Ross:Uh-huh I see that.
 Ross:What? What?
 Ross:Hey! I just spoke to your dad and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
 Ross:Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
 Ross:She said what?
 Ross:Postpone it? Emily do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isn’t right.
 Ross:I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)
 Ross:The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.
 Ross:No. I’m saying it’s now. (He starts putting on his pants backwards again.)
 Ross:There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
 Ross:(chasing her trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No wait! Emily! No wait stop! Emily please—(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)
 Ross:Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
 Ross:Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
 Ross:Hey-hey since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady here’s a pickle what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:I don’t know I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
 Ross:Excuse me?
 Ross:I don’t know. A month?
 Ross:I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
 Ross:Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
 Ross:Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
 Ross:Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks and-and-and flowers and candles…
 Ross:But-but if you don’t love this we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really it’s fine whatever you want.
 Ross:And I don’t know if it starts to rain…
 Ross:(Ross hugs his mom and dad)Hi. Mom. Dad.
 Ross:what’s up Dad?
 Ross:(Holding him back.)Dad dad please. Look I don’t want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright shes had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (Picks up the bill.) Now here here let me go talk to him okay?
 Ross:Look face it my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
 Ross:I go back there with lawn ornaments he’s going to laugh in my face.
 Ross:Look were down to just one point. Could we please maybe just settle it after the wedding.
 Ross:(Screaming) I’m getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
 Ross:I’m getting married to..day!!
 Ross:Ahh whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.
 Ross:(Using a slightly different inflection for each.) I do. I do. I do.
 Ross:(Very Nervous)Really?
 Ross:Dad!! (Emily comes running in.)
 Ross:Nothing nothing. Everythings under control.
 Ross:(Stepping in between them.)Okay! Okay! That’s it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right this is our wedding day!   From now on everyone gets along and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! (Pointing at his mother.) That’s right!!
 Ross:(Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in her wedding dress.) My god. You...you look beautiful.
 Ross:You know what I think we’ve had all the bad luck we’re going to have. (He hugs her.)

 Ross:Look I’m sorry.
 Ross:Oh right!
 Ross:(Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone along with Emily.)
 Ross:(entering) Emily?!
 Ross:No I’ve looked everywhere!
 Ross:No! For all I know she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No from now on I’m staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.
 Ross:Actually do you guys mind staying here for a while?
 Ross:(disappointed) That’s cool.
 Ross:Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this y’know but you don’t have to rub my butt.
 Ross:Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)
 Ross:Wait well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
 Ross:Now hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look look your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah I said Rachel’s name but it didn’t mean anything Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all! (Rachel sits down depressed.) That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please promise me that you’ll tell her that.
 Ross:Rach! Rach!
 Ross:Hi! What are you what are you doing here?

 Ross:Yeah would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway why cant you just do that?
 Ross:Oh-oh-okay but-but I know that even though Ive been a-a complete idiot up til now I mean I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.

 Ross:Oh that is so great! Thats…
 Ross:So I asked Emily if she would come to New York and she said yes.
 Ross:No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
 Ross:I told her Id have to think about it. I mean how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (Theyre all quiet.) Im actually asking you!
 Ross:Thanks for the help problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)
 Ross:(entering) Okay thats it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult so Im just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and starts shaking a…)
 Ross:Well I dont know what else to do. I mean I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before Im 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion lets hear it! Cause I-I got nothing! All right dont be shy any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
 Ross:For what?
 Ross:Yeah I uh totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? Im waiting for a call from Emily.
 Ross:Its not that easy theres still a lot of relationship stuff.
 Ross:Just stuff. Yknow kinda what Emily wants.
 Ross:No. No. You-you cant help. I mean I kinda have to do this without your help.
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:(answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look umm yes Ive been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not knowing whats going on.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey.
 Ross:Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
 Ross:Damn!
 Ross:I told Emily to come. And I just need to yknow talk to Rachel about it.
 Ross:Well look Im just trying to focus on the I get to see my wife part all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig of Pepto Bismol.)
 Ross:I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
 Ross:So Rach yknow-yknow how Emilys coming right?
 Ross:Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this the last time I talked to Emily…
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Le Poos still alive?!
 Ross:Hey so uh yknow how theres something I wanted to talk to you about?
 Ross:Well yknow how Im trying to work things out with Emily. Well theres this one thing… Okay (Rachel has her back turned to the camera and Ross isnt looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachels nose)-Oh hey!
 Ross:Youre nose is bleeding!
 Ross:Umm… (Rachel blows her nose.)
 Ross:Okay I uh I cant see you anymore.
 Ross:Hey. Rachel I-I-Ive been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really I just have to get it out.
 Ross:Okay yknow how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
 Ross:And while that was good advice you should know that what-what she wants…
 Ross:…is for me not to see you anymore.
 Ross:Its awful I know I mean I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
 Ross:You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
 Ross:What are you doing?
 Ross:Rachel this is your apartment.
 Ross:You shouldve seen the look on her face. I dont want Rachel to hate me! I dont know what to do.
 Ross:Yes! Please!
 Ross:Thats okay.
 Ross:Thats not advice!
 Ross:Im going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)
 Ross:(entering) Pheebs you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:I talked to Monica look Im the one who made the choice. Im the one whos making things change so I should be the one to yknow step back.
 Ross:No no its okay. Really. Theyre plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is is that better?
 Ross:Well what-what would you do? Rach if you were me what-what would you do?
 Ross:I cant believe this is happening.
 Ross:I am so sorry.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:How come? Everybody else does.
 Ross:Oh umm Im just getting rid of a couple of things.
 Ross:Yes yes it is! No but its good its—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff thats just ours together. Yknow brand new.
 Ross:Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
 Ross:Look if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York Im sure everything will be fine.
 Ross:After what I did? Can you blame her?
 Ross:(on the phone) No-no-no its just a bit sudden. (Listens) No its great. Okay? Im totally on board. I love you too all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)
 Ross:Nothing. Oh actually great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like Im moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
 Ross:Well her thought is and I agree fresh new furniture why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet its got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
 Ross:Yes! Yes! I mean its-its kinda far from work but uh yknow Ill get so much done on the commute. I-Ive been given the gift of time!
 Ross:(on phone) I know I miss you too. I cant wait to see you. I love you. Bye. (Hangs up.)
 Ross:No-no this is my collection of fossil samples.
 Ross:Im really gonna miss this apartment. Yknow Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. (Points.)
 Ross:I loved this place! To tell you the truth I wish I didnt have to move.
 Ross:Well I mean if uh if Emily gave me a choice…
 Ross:Why?
 Ross:Whats going on?
 Ross:Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right its about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because its not all laughing happy candy in the sky drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! Its real life okay? Its what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)
 Ross:Yep.
 Ross:Yknow what? Im really not in the mood.
 Ross:Look this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
 Ross:Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
 Ross:You do huh?
 Ross:What are you talking about?
 Ross:Wait! Wait! Wait! Yknow what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
 Ross:Hey! Hey look! Ugly Naked Guys back!
 Ross:Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah were just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh yeah sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.
 Ross:Yknow what? Uh Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)
 Ross:Yeah yeah shes here.
 Ross:(on phone) Hi.
 Ross:(going onto the patio) Look Emily Im just having dinner with my friends okay?
 Ross:Emily thats ridiculous. Look Im-Im moving for you Im cutting friends out of my life for you. Please just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay youll see youre the only person I want to be with.
 Ross:Well you cant know where I am all the time. Look this marriage is never gonna work if you dont trust me.
 Ross:So can you trust me?
 Ross:Well I guess thats it.
 Ross:My marriage is over.
 Ross:Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
 Ross:Emilys cousin kicked me out!
 Ross:Well when youre subletting an apartment from your wifes cousin and then you get a divorce sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
 Ross:Who needs a lease when its family!
 Ross:You got it.
 Ross:Thanks you guys I really appreciate this. All right Im gonna get packing again. Man Ive been moving around so much Im beginning to feel like a nomad.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
 Ross:Oh yeah I know I know its a lot of boxes but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
 Ross:Oh I uh hope you dont mind I kinda uh jazzed it up a little. Check this out. (He plays the greeting and We Will Rock You starts to play and Rosss voice comes over it.) We will we will call you back!
 Ross:Pretty cool huh?
 Ross:(glaring at him) Joey please! (Motions to his computer.)
 Ross:(entering) Uh fellas (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
 Ross:Ill take sports.
 Ross:All right. Uhh international.
 Ross:Well I guess I can check out those apartment listings even though theres never anything in here.
 Ross:(looks) Oh yeah! Youre—hey youre right! Heres an affordable place (reading ad) two bedroom close to work ooh its available in five weeks!
 Ross:Oh I-I dont know its kind of expensive for a studio.
 Ross:Okay lets go.
 Ross:Oh-oh-ooh hey guys I was wondering if you guys would uh maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all we all are using it.
 Ross:Oh my God! (Looking around which doesnt take him long.)
 Ross:I think this is it. I dont know maybe we should keep looking.
 Ross:(To Joey) So you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
 Ross:(To Chandler) How about you?
 Ross:All right I see what you guys are saying. Ill uh Ill go downstairs and fill out an application.
 Ross:Hey. So I uh I didnt get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
 Ross:Yeah. But the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So…
 Ross:Look you guys dont need me here taking up your space.
 Ross:Are you guys sure about this?
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:So Im a pimp huh? Its okay! Look I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the quiet down maneuver).
 Ross:(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on its fun!
 Ross:I couldnt possibly eat another bite.
 Ross:Huh I dont know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
 Ross:Im sorry. Its just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
 Ross:Oh God no.
 Ross:Youre right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
 Ross:In this life Phoebe.
 Ross:Yeah thats the same.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Uh everyone this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
 Ross:Oh this is Monica.
 Ross:Oh mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesnt eat any Thanksgiving food.
 Ross:So uh Rach? Does it does it feel weird around here now? Yknow since Ive been away at college.
 Ross:Well thats cool. So did… (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)
 Ross:Umm Im sorry Judy I couldnt find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
 Ross:(in a high pitched voice) Monica!
 Ross:So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Yknow maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Listen Roland Chang if things go well I’m gonna be out with her all night.
 Ross:All right its cool you can stay here. My parents wont mind.

 Ross:I cant believe you let George Michael slap you.
 Ross:Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving!
 Ross:So uh wheres Monica?
 Ross:Dude!
 Ross:Oh mom! Okay umm her name is Carol. And shes really pretty. And smart. And uh shes-shes on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
 Ross:Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe you just said it!

 Ross:Well theyre not mine!
 Ross:Why are they here?
 Ross:(entering depressed) Hi.
 Ross:Someone at work ate my sandwich!
 Ross:My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I cant believe someone ate it!
 Ross:Just a sandwich? Look I am 30 years old Im about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
 Ross:(quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still cant believe someone ate it!! I mean look I left a note and everything.
 Ross:Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh Keep your mitts off my grub?
 Ross:(entering) Phoebe!
 Ross:Phoebe! Youre note amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah a guy called me mental! Mental Geller yeah I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
 Ross:That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway people are writing reports for me uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule Im telling you you get tough with people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani give me that coffee! Now!
 Ross:Yeah of course Donald.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:(Proudly) Yeah.
 Ross:Oh no you-you dont understand. Ugh this is so silly. Umm this is all because of a sandwich.
 Ross:Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is she puts a an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…
 Ross:What?
 Ross:You ate my sandwich?
 Ross:(getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
 Ross:Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
 Ross:(getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!
 Ross:(jumping to his feet in anger) What?
 Ross:You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
 Ross:(losing control we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
 Ross:MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Rosss scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
 Ross:(in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
 Ross:Im fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
 Ross:On account of my rage.
 Ross:He gave me a pill for it.
 Ross:Uh-huh. Well when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so I took it.
 Ross:I dont know. Its going to be weird not having a job for a while but I I definitely dont care about my sandwich.
 Ross:(entering with the rest of the gang) Whats going on?
 Ross:(covering his eyes) Dude! Thats my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)
 Ross:Yeah whats going on?
 Ross:You slept with my sister?
 Ross:This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)
 Ross:My God Monica!!
 Ross:Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joeys underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
 Ross:I...reorganized the fridge. See bottom shelf meats and dairy. (There’s nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf fruits and vegetables. (There’s one lone tomato.) And top shelf expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)
 Ross:Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank post office and the dry cleaners.
 Ross:Hey I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!
 Ross:So what we just sit?
 Ross:Im sorry man. Hey yknow what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Yknow like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
 Ross:Or that.
 Ross:Ill help you. Yeah Ill make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus itll give me something to do.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:(grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right well start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
 Ross:And it cant be Joey.
 Ross:Or Joseph.
 Ross:All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters he looks suspicious. (Stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) Thats it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey youre supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! (Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is and what is all this?! (Reading.) The official rulebook of Fireball.
 Ross:This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
 Ross:(To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better Joey needs to work. (To Joey) Now come on!
 Ross:No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! (After Joey walks past Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)
 Ross:So Pheebs are you gonna go back out there or what?
 Ross:Oh-oh yeah.
 Ross:Uh you weighted 200 pounds.
 Ross:Yeah not since I got too strong for you.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Oh fine.
 Ross:Joeys not going.
 Ross:Because tomorrow hes redoing yesterdays pages.
 Ross:I think hes been relaxing enough thanks to you and Fireball.
 Ross:I am not unemployed. Im on sabbatical!
 Ross:And the reason Im doing this is because I am Joeys friend. And if you were a good friend youd be doing the same thing.
 Ross:If it does? Then youre an amazing friend of mine.
 Ross:How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now no ones going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
 Ross:No you didnt. You said you would but you never did!
 Ross:Hey if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
 Ross:Yay!
 Ross:I guess when you dont have so many distractions its easier for you to focus. Huh?
 Ross:All right. (Takes another copy.)
 Ross:Hey man.
 Ross:About yesterday I was really wrong. I am sorry.
 Ross:Maybe it was both of us but we had our best friends interest… (Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friends interest at heart.
 Ross:I dont know Im one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right Joey we get it. (To Chandler) Im sorry.

 Ross:Powder! Yeah! Yeah I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.)
 Ross:Yeah okay hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It doesnt work and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.) Theyre not coming on man.
 Ross:Ohh I-I see lotion I have lotion! Will that work?
 Ross:Hold on.
 Ross:Theyre still theyre still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
 Ross:What difference does that make?!

 Ross:Oh be-because of the leather pants.
 Ross:Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh yknow they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) Im gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monicas bedroom.) I cant believe he thinks Im a cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monicas room.)

 Ross:Yknow what? It sounds so weird to say this but I just had a great day with Janice!
 Ross:Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff thats been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
 Ross:Thanks!
 Ross:Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how Im on sabbatical from work right?
 Ross:Oh…
 Ross:This isnt what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…
 Ross:Okay. Sometimes I feel…

 Ross:OH…MY…GOD!!
 Ross:I am now.
 Ross:Dude we got to talk.
 Ross:I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isnt too weird but uh I had uh a thing with Janice. (He laughs his real laugh this time.) What youre-youre not mad?
 Ross:Well because yknow there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You dont uh you dont fool around with your uh friends ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls theyre related to.
 Ross:Okay.

 Ross:Well maybe he just didnt want to hurt your feelings.
 Ross:What kind of problem?
 Ross:Nooooo!
 Ross:Ironically most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
 Ross:Hey! Hey! If hes moving maybe I should try to get his place!
 Ross:It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
 Ross:Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isnt it perfect?! I cant believe I never realized how great it is!
 Ross:(laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)
 Ross:(entering) Whats going on?
 Ross:What?! What?!
 Ross:Actually it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Well I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and hes already had like a hundred applicants.
 Ross:No-no I got the edge. I know its not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
 Ross:No.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:A basket of mini-muffins.
 Ross:The small one.
 Ross:Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
 Ross:Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! Theres twelve bucks Ill never see again! (Exits.)
 Ross:Noooo.
 Ross:Look Ive already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because weve been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh lets see now he had the trampoline.
 Ross:Well he had gravity boots.
 Ross:Okay Ive got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He opens the door and stops.) Hey didnt he used to have a cat?
 Ross:Right. (Exits.)
 Ross:Good evening sir. My name is Ross Geller. Im one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—Im sorry.

 Ross:A new place for a new Ross. Im gonna have you and all the guys from work over once its yknow furnished.

 Ross:What the hell are doing?!!
 Ross:(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!

 Ross:What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the door.) You all knew and you didnt tell me?!!
 Ross:(happily again) You were worried about me? You didnt know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)
 Ross:Hey you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…
 Ross:You cant just call Godfather. Dont you think her brother should be Godfather?
 Ross:(opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!

 Ross:No wait look. Look! Im sorry its just Ive never even met Howard. I-I mean I dont know Howard.

For everyone in the building and Im gonna sit them down and explain to them I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! Im just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
 Ross:It doesnt matter! Its my principles! Were talking about my principles!
 Ross:Oh theyll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
 Ross:Oh no!
 Ross:Well unless you make some kind of big gesture.
 Ross:Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
 Ross:What are you doing?
 Ross:You chipped in?!
 Ross:Phoebe! I cant believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
 Ross:Yeah but youre making me look bad!
 Ross:(trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
 Ross:(tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
 Ross:Look this is a disaster! Cant I please just go?

 Ross:This is fun. Hey Rach remember that whole We were on a break thing? Well Im sorry will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. Theyre just staring at him in shock.)

 Ross:Pheebs we had the most incredible night! Okay so were in the car…
 Ross:Okay okay so were in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
 Ross:Yeah but-but he didnt know that!
 Ross:And it couldve just as easily have been a bullet.
 Ross:Wow! I couldve died tonight.
 Ross:I do have a newfound respect for life.
 Ross:Rach what uh what are you doing here?
 Ross:Yknow it-it doesnt matter. The important thing is that youre here. Youre my friend and youre here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)
 Ross:The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
 Ross:Okay okay we were on the ride along with Gary right?
 Ross:And somebody took a shot at me!
 Ross:No a car backfired but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Yknow? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
 Ross:(stares at her briefly) Okay why are you here?
 Ross:You talked to her?
 Ross:Well okay what-what did she say?
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Huh? Yeah! Yes of course!
 Ross:Right. I guess I guess I should call Emily.
 Ross:Okay look yesterday I wouldve even considered calling her back but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean that-that has got to mean something!
 Ross:You werent there! Okay maybe this is something that I-Im supposed to seize! Yknow?
 Ross:Huh.
 Ross:That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity but I-I really dont wanna see or talk to her.
 Ross:Yeah. Maybe today is just close call day.
 Ross:Hey thanks Rach. (They hug.)
 Ross:Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didnt erase it.
 Ross:(on machine) Hey Ross its you! (Hits the stop button) Oh yeah no thats-thats an old message nobody needs to hear that.
 Ross:(looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm was-was Monica here?
 Ross:Yeah I want my money back.
 Ross:Hey Pheebs has Gary ever been shot at for real?
 Ross:I wonder how I would react under fire yknow? And not backfire but-but heavy fire like I was in a war or something.
 Ross:I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
 Ross:Uh-huh thats why they call it Staten Island.
 Ross:(he catches the ball and pauses staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an island.
 Ross:(looks at his watch) 217.
 Ross:Are you serious?!
 Ross:Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
 Ross:You bought Shawn Cassidy!
 Ross:What-what is it?!
 Ross:Why is it inside out?!
 Ross:How much did you pay for that?
 Ross:Yeah? How much?
 Ross:ON A CAT??!!!!
 Ross:Free cats do that too yknow. {Which reminds me if I might get a little political here support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from you get a much better deal from the shelter plus they probably wont die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash go to the shelter and save its life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
 Ross:(To Joey) Hey you wanna get something to eat or uh do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Uhh yeah it would! Lets do it!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Dont switch hands okay?
 Ross:…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
 Ross:How do you know? You dont have a watch.
 Ross:Monica whatever you do do not drop that ball!
 Ross:2 hours 27 minutes.
 Ross:Hey Rach!
 Ross:Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin it!
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Doesnt sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
 Ross:(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! Were on the same team!
 Ross:Its really a uh-uh three person game yknow?
 Ross:All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
 Ross:Baking it didnt help huh?
 Ross:Im starving!
 Ross:Im still hungry!
 Ross:I am!
 Ross:Oh thank God!
 Ross:I know. My arm is killing me.
 Ross:Whats going on?
 Ross:Oh God here we go!
 Ross:Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone elses she like freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
 Ross:Hey does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes his eye)
 Ross:All right I gotta go. Im taking Ben to the park.

 Ross:Okay when youre playing a machine and it hasnt paid out a lurker waits for you to give up and then…
 Ross:No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
 Ross:Uh-hmm.

 Ross:Okay there was some staring and pointing.
 Ross:Oh hey yknow they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because its all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is one big drink!
 Ross:(looking at the price list) Umm… Wow! Thats-thats some pricey nut!
 Ross:Really like those Macadamia nuts huh?
 Ross:(gets up) All right. Yknow what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right come on come on well play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.

 Ross:That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.)
 Ross:Ohh its Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)
 Ross:Ill do it. Hey whatever you need me to do Im your man. (He starts to sit down on the bed. Theres one problem though hes about two feet to the left of it. Needless to say he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you are you okay?
 Ross:Ohh heres that Macadamia nut!
 Ross:(he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the bed.)
 Ross:I wanna get out of the room! Yknow I…I really miss downstairs.
 Ross:Well hello! Im Ross!
 Ross:Excuse me sir youve got a little something right here. (He points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
 Ross:(bowing) Hello!
 Ross:Well hello Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
 Ross:Well hello Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
 Ross:Why are we in bed together?
 Ross:(checks) Yeah.
 Ross:No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh did we? I mean I don’t remember much about last night it was such a blur.
 Ross:And we didn’t have sex.
 Ross:(getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has Just Married written on his back.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
 Ross:We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
 Ross:I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
 Ross:Laugh it up but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:No-no that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah actually um I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
 Ross:I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
 Ross:Yes exactly!
 Ross:Wow! This is so amazing. I uh I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.
 Ross:I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
 Ross:Okay look how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!
 Ross:I’m asking you to do me a favor.
 Ross:And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Listen I know you wanted to talk to me but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register and you get to keep all the presents!
 Ross:I don’t know if it’s true.
 Ross:Oh okay y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
 Ross:All right. All right I’ll do it.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh yeah no problems. It’s all taken care of.
 Ross:Oh yeah why not?
 Ross:Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh you wanna hear something weird?
 Ross:I didn’t get the annulment.
 Ross:We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh yeah no problems. It’s all taken care of.
 Ross:Oh yeah why not?
 Ross:Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh you wanna hear something weird?
 Ross:I didn’t get the annulment.
 Ross:We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey do you have any gum?
 Ross:I know.
 Ross:Well I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was Three divorces. Three divorces! Look I just don’t want my tombstone to read Ross Gellar Three Divorces.
 Ross:Look all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!
 Ross:Well okay so I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel please?
 Ross:Hey! Hi!
 Ross:What’s up?
 Ross:Oh my God. Ohh my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh that’s great. That’s great. (Kisses and hugs her.)
 Ross:Bye.
 Ross:Could ya just could ya just lay off please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!
 Ross:(interrupting) No! No I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh Murderer Guy and-and Geologists.
 Ross:Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
 Ross:What?! Why?
 Ross:And if you wait right here I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
 Ross:…once you know the stories it’s not that bad. First marriage wife’s hidden sexuality not my fault. Second marriage said the wrong name at the altar a little my fault. Third marriage well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face Nevada’s fault.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:This is crazy! I mean yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past but now she is just my wife! Phoebe will you-will you help me out here?
 Ross:We were drunk! I would’ve married uh Joey with that amount of alcohol!
 Ross:(to the panel) Look I’m sorry but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.
 Ross:(getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leans down to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!
 Ross:Yes.
 Ross:Yes second in two years. Third overall.
 Ross:Basically Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…
 Ross:Yes-yes-yes! But I-I do not love her.
 Ross:This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
 Ross:I think just the annulment for today.
 Ross:Easy.
 Ross:No problem.
 Ross:Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh it was it was already taken care of.
 Ross:Uh-ha what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.
 Ross:Oh no.
 Ross:I couldn’t.
 Ross:It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…
 Ross:I… I do I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
 Ross:I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
 Ross:Ohh what’s wrong?!
 Ross:Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.
 Ross:Of course.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh that. Umm she took it really well.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her as a friend.
 Ross:It’s nothing I just gave her a hug.
 Ross:It’s also a sign of friendship.
 Ross:(grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
 Ross:S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
 Ross:I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoebe raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
 Ross:(grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in love then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Rach uh you still looking for a place?
 Ross:Okay there’s this guy Warren from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh you interested?
 Ross:Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number.
 Ross:Okay you go grab it!
 Ross:I don’t know what you’re talking about.
 Ross:Look I do not re-love her.
 Ross:Look we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
 Ross:You can live with me.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
 Ross:Well I’m-I’m just glad I could y’know help you out.
 Ross:Hero I uh I don’t know—well all right.
 Ross:Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You’re gonna say things now aren’t ya?
 Ross:Hey! Oh listen I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
 Ross:What do you mean they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?
 Ross:What?! Over a stupid room!
 Ross:Oh no yeah no that part’s great!
 Ross:What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean that is so silly!
 Ross:Well apparently not and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean enough of the silliness!
 Ross:(stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points look I’ve known you both a long time and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important love or silliness?
 Ross:Okay! All right! Now Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica right?
 Ross:And Mon you wanna live with Chandler don’t ya?
 Ross:(jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! (Storms out.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey Rach!
 Ross:You’re never gonna believe it uh Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?
 Ross:Yeah but on the bright side we get to be roommates again.
 Ross:Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it why would it be weird?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place I mean are you still in that place?
 Ross:Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.
 Ross:Really?! We are?
 Ross:Ohh! That would be great.
 Ross:(laughs as well but for a different reason) Yeah I didn’t think of that.
 Ross:So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!
 Ross:No I-I-I’m serious okay? I mean think about it. You move in you start fighting over stupid game rooms next thing y’know you break up!
 Ross:Okay there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately this room (Points to Rachel’s room) could destroy you!!
 Ross:Fine! It’s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister but stops and tries one last time.) I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that’s what you want there’s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON’T DO IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
 Ross:(To Rachel) So umm where are the other guys?
 Ross:Fighting?!
 Ross:Yeah. There’s no breaking them up is there?
 Ross:Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
 Ross:Yeah I’m-I’m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah get out of here before I change my mind. (She exits)
 Ross:I’ve been back and forth.
 Ross:Ehh I don’t I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know dating other guys.
 Ross:Yeah well m-maybe you’re right.
 Ross:Is that what I want?
 Ross:Whoa! Whoa! Whoa Joey!
 Ross:How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh in a way you-you complete me (Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
 Ross:(in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen matey!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
 Ross:Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always Ross what are you gonna do about Rachel? Ross why-why are you moving in with Rachel? When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel? You want her!
 Ross:(answering it) Uh-oh saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?
 Ross:(on phone) No-no-no that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh Y uh U!
 Ross:Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate huh? They loved it.
 Ross:I know! Anyway they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary but uh if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox huh? Professor Geller.
 Ross:(entering) Hey everyone!
 Ross:Hey uh well today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys do you do you mind?
 Ross:(he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…
 Ross:(continuing) …subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…
 Ross:No! Why?
 Ross:Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler) into…
 Ross:Open with a joke? It’s a university not a comedy club!
 Ross:(gets up) Okay!
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:Please don’t say naked chicks.
 Ross:I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
 Ross:(entering) Hello!
 Ross:It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!
 Ross:I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all Ross you have to be funny and sexy. Well I proved them wrong! And now I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
 Ross:That’s right!
 Ross:(to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.
 Ross:Look I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
 Ross:Will you-will you please?
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:(in his British accent) I’m sorry I’ve got plans with my sister.
 Ross:(in accent) Right will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
 Ross:Just please stop!
 Ross:(entering) Look I really need some help okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
 Ross:They’re not listening too me?
 Ross:Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
 Ross:(in his head) All right keep going. We are phasing the accent out phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
 Ross:(British) Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh just came out. I’m sorry. So if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…
 Ross:(in the accent again) Well hello Rachel!
 Ross:Look I was going to tell you!
 Ross:Okay maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.
 Ross:Rach come on if you think about it it’s actually kinda funny. (He laughs and he laughs alone.) Okay maybe it’s best not to think about it.
 Ross:Phoebe I told her you already knew.
 Ross:Okay I got us a court date for tomorrow at 200 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.
 Ross:Okay Rach but…
 Ross:Look I told you…
 Ross:Look if you’d had two failed marriages you’d understand!
 Ross:What about the time I said we were on a break?
 Ross:Fine I’m mentally unstable.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!
 Ross:Oh come on!
 Ross:Okay I’m sorry this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin I’m not gay and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look I’ll consummate this marriage right here right now!
 Ross:And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
 Ross:(stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny funny form!
 Ross:And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He’s still typing.) Stop typing! Stop typing!!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:My fault?! You threatened the judge!
 Ross:That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
 Ross:The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)
 Ross:I picked up the divorce papers. Uh I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.
 Ross:Y’know I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
 Ross:Okay how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
 Ross:Yeah! Right!
 Ross:You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s let’s just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?
 Ross:Okay can we just sign please?
 Ross:Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Excuse me?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:So then if-if—I mean if you think about it this is all (Pause.) your fault.
 Ross:I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women never thought I would be divorcing you.
 Ross:Did I did I even treat?
 Ross:That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.
 Ross:Eh no problem.
 Ross:Totally. (Exits.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Whoa-whoa-whoa Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
 Ross:I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
 Ross:Oh but-but I can’t do it.
 Ross:Because because I’ve got Ben.
 Ross:Of course he is! What do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
 Ross:(to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.
 Ross:Oh I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.
 Ross:Ben say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay talk to you later.
 Ross:(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon how’s the packing going? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.
 Ross:And now you want that money back.
 Ross:Chandler what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)
 Ross:I’m sorry you lost your money but I won it fair and square.
 Ross:Now if you wanna try to make some of it back I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you I am very good at Cups.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:So I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030 therell be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
 Ross:Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
 Ross:So uh wha-uh what do you do?
 Ross:Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
 Ross:Yeah yeah man dont do it. I mean if you date her then-then-then I cant date her.

 Ross:Look Chandler Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God shes going to sit on you.
 Ross:Yeah the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.) And that goes back up there.
 Ross:Yeah that-that doesnt look right.
 Ross:Whoa whoa but then the back of the couch wont line up with he back of the carpet.

 Ross:(not paying attention) Yeah they don’t like you.
 Ross:I dunno maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-
 Ross:(trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don’t want to play video games Joey!
 Ross:For real?
 Ross:Yeah see we-we-we have to stop across the hall because it’s my sister. But uh uh y’know actually growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah you-you should tell your friends that.
 Ross:And the place looks so nice!
 Ross:Happy Thanksgiving!
 Ross:See ya!
 Ross:Oh oh we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.
 Ross:Some would say she’s attractive yes.
 Ross:(to Joey) Dude we were good!
 Ross:Oh but-but it is uh it’s just like the first Thanksgiving when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh sat down to dinner.
 Ross:Yeah yeah what is it?
 Ross:W-What was the one right before bananas?
 Ross:Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no there is no way!
 Ross:Oh my God the pages are stuck together!
 Ross:Oh My God she-she made half a English Trifle and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!
 Ross:No no we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.
 Ross:Yeah it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
 Ross:(worried) Dude I need to talk to you a sec.
 Ross:Okay I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.
 Ross:Okay remember we were young. Hey Spring break sophomore year I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
 Ross:I don’t know aheh your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.
 Ross:How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
 Ross:I don’t know I-I was all high.
 Ross:Okay okay I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
 Ross:Alright alright now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
 Ross:Okay fine!
 Ross:Oh uh can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
 Ross:What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving not...Truth-Day!
 Ross:Okay okay we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! (Referring to the dancers.)
 Ross:Hey Rach can I talk to you outside for a second?
 Ross:So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us hm?
 Ross:And um...You look nice today.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(shocked) Eh?
 Ross:(cutting her off) You’re alone.
 Ross:(just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well can’t blame a guy for trying!
 Ross:Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like he’s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
 Ross:It tastes like feet!
 Ross:Are you kidding?
 Ross:Oh yeah about telling Mom and Dad I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
 Ross:Wha-what?
 Ross:(in a 5 year old’s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom Dad you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
 Ross:Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.
 Ross:Yeah well Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing Monica did!
 Ross:Monica and Chandler are living together!
 Ross:I-I uh I got tricked into all those things!
 Ross:Hey
 Ross:Wow Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
 Ross:… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
 Ross:I am so over Janine. I mean yeah at first I thought she was hot but now she’s like OLD NEWS!
 Ross:Hi Janine!
 Ross:You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
 Ross:Oh well you see how it works is the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah not a lot of people know that.
 Ross:Are you serious?
 Ross:Bye Janine!
 Ross:It was a dry day.
 Ross:Oh my God!
 Ross:Got it!
 Ross:Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!
 Ross:Yeah I have a question. When is this gonna air?
 Ross:Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
 Ross:Why do they keep doing that?
 Ross:Right.
 Ross:Hey what’d you guys do to get up on there?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:We know!
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Monica! (Pause) Would it?
 Ross:Hey I know what’ll get us up on a platform!
 Ross:The routine!
 Ross:Hey when the snippy guy sees the routine he’ll wanna build us our own platform!
 Ross:We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look it’s almost fake midnight do we really have any other choice?
 Ross:So do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?
 Ross:Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Hey when the music starts up again I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot y’know? (He mimics a robot)
 Ross:I don’t know I mean you were a lot bigger I mean stronger back then.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You kissed her.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You like it?
 Ross:It’s my new apothecary table!
 Ross:Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
 Ross:Why did you do that?
 Ross:She hates Pottery Barn?!!
 Ross:What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)
 Ross:Uh yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!
 Ross:Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.
 Ross:Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
 Ross:Hey Pheebs could you please not put your feet up on my new…(On Rachel’s glare)…old sheet?
 Ross:My apothecary table!!!
 Ross:I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
 Ross:Of course not it smells like wine which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
 Ross:Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
 Ross:A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
 Ross:(glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.
 Ross:Hmm a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)
 Ross:Really?! (To Rachel) Hey y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need uh ooh here’s-here’s 60 bucks why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
 Ross:She does want to.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Y’know what would cheer you up?
 Ross:I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night I think you should come.
 Ross:Hey you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
 Ross:Yeah they print jokes interviews hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.
 Ross:(showing them the page) Here check it out. It’s the first one too.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Uh oh-oh no you didn’t. I did.
 Ross:Hey tell Dan ‘Thanks.’
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Look Chandler it’s my joke. But hey if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit right?
 Ross:No it’s my joke it’s mine. You can call them they’ll tell you.
 Ross:It’s my joke.
 Ross:You know Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
 Ross:What you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.
 Ross:Your joke? Well I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
 Ross:Well I was going to stick it in the ATM but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
 Ross:Oh what are you going to do follow me down there?
 Ross:Well I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
 Ross:(showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh hey Gunther check this out.
 Ross:Uh yeah I’ll take a coffee. Thanks man.
 Ross:Yeah why would it be weird? Hey Joey can I get some coffee?
 Ross:Seriously I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.
 Ross:Joey seriously can I get my coffee?
 Ross:It’s my joke.
 Ross:Y’know I don’t think we’re going to settle this.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Hey Mon.
 Ross:Monica! (She appears not sure why she was summoned.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Yeah but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.
 Ross:We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.
 Ross:See I would never snap at you like that.
 Ross:Are you kidding? Okay look. I-I studied evolution. Remember evolution? Monkey into man? Plus I’m a doctor and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!
 Ross:It’s your joke.
 Ross:No way.
 Ross:Hey Joey how come our stuff isn’t free?
 Ross:Hey does anyone have any gum?
 Ross:Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.
 Ross:Hi Jill.
 Ross:Jill how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
 Ross:I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
 Ross:Sorry-sorry Jill.
 Ross:Huh? Oh I got this—(Holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!
 Ross:Yeah! Oh I-I love this babies!
 Ross:Ross wants a pajmena?
 Ross:It’s a rug. (Jill winces.)
 Ross:Yeah. Everything but the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)
 Ross:Well. Hey…
 Ross:Oh yeah how about you and the (mimics her fake cry) I’m sorry!
 Ross:Oh stop.
 Ross:No you stop!
 Ross:(entering) Rach? Hi!
 Ross:Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
 Ross:Oh wow! I mean wow! I mean I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her never!
 Ross:Yeah but after you said it was okay I figured Why not?!
 Ross:I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey if you ever want to go out with Monica you have my blessing.
 Ross:(entering) Hi Jill!
 Ross:Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
 Ross:Rachel! Well you-you’re not at home you’re-you’re-you’re right here.
 Ross:Okay. So well I’ll umm (To Rachel) I’ll have her home by midnight.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Uhh it was okay. Yeah it was fun.
 Ross:I guess so.
 Ross:No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh show her slides of my favorite fossils.
 Ross:Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
 Ross:Anyway if she if she wasn’t in to me why-why would she ask me out again?
 Ross:Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night Valentine’s Day the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides if you know what I mean.
 Ross:(while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay. (Rachel stops.) It’s okay. Hey it’s too weird for you I won’t see her again.
 Ross:I mean after tomorrow night.
 Ross:Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.
 Ross:You want me to call her right now?
 Ross:Well umm oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
 Ross:Hey! Uh Phoebe’s not here is she?
 Ross:And-and I and I saw that Joey was about to go in so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. (They all kinda look at him.)
 Ross:Yeah! Good for you Joe!
 Ross:You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time I swear to… (Opens the door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh uh Jill. Umm that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm they’ve really taken a liking to me. (Quickly looks out to see if they’re watching.) Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?
 Ross:Of course what happened? (Lets her in.)
 Ross:Okay umm…
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Wow! Really?!
 Ross:Well I’d love to! Here you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!
 Ross:Ohh!
 Ross:Slides are almost ready.
 Ross:Uh okay well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.
 Ross:(answering it) Hello?
 Ross:O-okay Rach calm-calm down okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.
 Ross:So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
 Ross:Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.) Whoa! Uh that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.
 Ross:(To Rachel) You uh you may have been right about Jill.
 Ross:Umm she kissed me.
 Ross:Look I uh I tried not to kiss her okay?
 Ross:Let me finish okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…
 Ross:Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
 Ross:Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
 Ross:No I mean look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
 Ross:You’re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)
 Ross:You take care Jill.
 Ross:I know what you mean I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.
 Ross:The first time! No seriously imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.
 Ross:I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. (That’s karate he’s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know not doing anything else physical.
 Ross:No I just think Monica was that fat.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Hey do you guys think that if all those things happened we’d still hang out?
 Ross:(recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?
 Ross:No-no. It’s-it’s me Ross!
 Ross:No no-no Ross Geller.
 Ross:Yeah. Right.
 Ross:Good-good I’m-I’m married. (Shows her his ring.)
 Ross:Is-isn’t it the best?
 Ross:Oh really really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street umm do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
 Ross:Yeah? Oh-oh she’d be so excited!
 Ross:Come on! (They start to leave.)
 Ross:No it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him but I don’t…
 Ross:(putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.
 Ross:Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey here you go buddy. Sorry no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay let’s go see Monica!
 Ross:Hey Mon!
 Ross:Mon look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)
 Ross:And and uh you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)
 Ross:And that’s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)
 Ross:(answering it) 1987 the day after Christmas at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
 Ross:Sometimes you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime! I’ll play you one of my other…
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey-hey or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
 Ross:Come on Pheebs it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.
 Ross:Well umm I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Well last weekend…
 Ross:…will be two months…
 Ross:…since I stopped trying.
 Ross:What-what do you mean?
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Okay I think I got it.
 Ross:So honey this morning was fun huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
 Ross:Look Carol umm I was I was thinking maybe uh maybe we can spice things up a little.
 Ross:Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…
 Ross:Hey there little fella! Hey uh-hey why don’t we get some shoes on ya huh? Hey why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on in your room! Yay!!
 Ross:Yay! (To Carol) Seriously our sex life… I was thinking maybe I don’t know we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun?
 Ross:Well I don’t know umm (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carol’s shocked and obviously doesn’t like that idea.) Umm some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesn’t like that idea either.) Nah! Umm y’know we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm we could we could have a threesome.
 Ross:Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
 Ross:I got it!
 Ross:(on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she can’t come to the phone right now. (Listens.) Oh right no problem. Okay bye-bye. (Hangs up.)
 Ross:J-j-just relax nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
 Ross:(To Monica) Yeah she’s fired.
 Ross:So honey this uh this threesome thing umm I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…
 Ross:Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well someone’s been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
 Ross:Oh I know. (Laughs) Y’know just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…
 Ross:Yeah? Well I-I think Ben’s asleep.
 Ross:Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
 Ross:Hey Pheebs!
 Ross:Hey how’s it going?
 Ross:She doesn’t know she was fired yet does she?
 Ross:Hey Pheebs maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
 Ross:We’re really gonna do this huh?
 Ross:Y’know if if this is too weird for you we can still back out at… (A knock on the door interrupts him.)
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:I’m-I’m Ross by the way.
 Ross:How hot is this?!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Look at you! You’re up!
 Ross:Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?
 Ross:No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:It was it was okay.
 Ross:Look it’s just did did you ever go to a party and think Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?
 Ross:Oh-oh absolutely!
 Ross:It’s just my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then and then there was a lot of waiting around.
 Ross:Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
 Ross:No she kept kicking me away!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Oh I a lot of stuff!
 Ross:A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
 Ross:Just a sandwich. Turkey a little mustard…
 Ross:It really was!
 Ross:Hey Rachel.
 Ross:Umm no.
 Ross:That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Okay. (He does so.)
 Ross:We’re sorry.
 Ross:Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?
 Ross:Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker look can I just say not all men are like that.
 Ross:Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
 Ross:Men. I guy I know.
 Ross:She is not… (Realizes) She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.
 Ross:I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
 Ross:Try telling my wife that.
 Ross:Hey remember when I had a monkey?
 Ross:Yeah what what was I thinking?
 Ross:What’s up with the greed Joe?
 Ross:Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean can’t-can’t you pick up I don’t know an extra shift here?
 Ross:Oh wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Hey what have you guys been up to?
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:After one class? I don’t think so.
 Ross:Well of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming that’s not enough. Look I studying kara-tay for a long time and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.
 Ross:No it’s a concept!
 Ross:All right maybe it means that too…
 Ross:Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!
 Ross:Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
 Ross:(moves closer) All I’m saying is it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack I don’t know like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel’s and screams) surprise!!
 Ross:All right you know that one was coming but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)
 Ross:Y’know what… (Moves away as Chandler enters panicked.)
 Ross:No.
 Ross:So what are you gonna do?
 Ross:DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
 Ross:A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing every time now.)
 Ross:Perhaps. Now I’m curious at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
 Ross:I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point but I—look I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage and Ross screams…) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.) Ahhh huh? Unagi.
 Ross:(not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.
 Ross:Unagi. I’m always aware.
 Ross:What’s up?
 Ross:Oh why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
 Ross:Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. (Picks up a model of the Saturn V rocket that’s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
 Ross:Yeah-yeah except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve 1968. They also took the famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
 Ross:Y’know what? I can easily get out of this but there is a chance you can get very very hurt!
 Ross:It’s a great class.
 Ross:Yeah yeah I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.) Umm hey a couple of questions though. Umm about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor what-what-what-what would you do next?
 Ross:No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
 Ross:Yes that’s right.
 Ross:I tired attacking two women did not work.
 Ross:No I mean it’s okay I mean they’re-they’re my friends. In fact I-I-I was married to one of them.
 Ross:Oh no! No-no! No I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that’s a no.
 Ross:Ah-ha nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)
 Ross:DANGER!!!!
 Ross:Hey! I just got uh my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!
 Ross:Oh I wish I knew but the evaluations are all anonymous.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:It’s a girl! Anyway it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.
 Ross:No but it is frowned upon.
 Ross:Besides there’s a big age difference.
 Ross:I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.
 Ross:(startled) Yeah?
 Ross:Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
 Ross:That was you?
 Ross:Oh I I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.
 Ross:What time?
 Ross:Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
 Ross:Oh! So-so seriously what time?
 Ross:What? Of course I did! You uh you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
 Ross:Oh uh I had trouble remembering everyone’s name so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
 Ross:Umm no. No.
 Ross:Umm it’s Cutie McPretty.
 Ross:Listen I gotta tell ya I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird the whole student teacher thing and to be frank I thought it would be too but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
 Ross:(pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
 Ross:We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
 Ross:Well not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night Judgey von Holierthanthou.
 Ross:Yeah. What-what should I do?
 Ross:Going out with who?
 Ross:Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for big boobies.)
 Ross:What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
 Ross:Oh you have some studying to do?
 Ross:Y’know I remember when uh when I was in college we used to… (He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
 Ross:Nothing I’m-I’m just I’m so comfortable with you!
 Ross:What? No! Of course of course I do! Are-are they gone?
 Ross:What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.) Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
 Ross:That’s right Lydia Elizabeth here is a student and uh we’re dating. And you may frown upon that but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Really? Its not just frowned upon?
 Ross:Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
 Ross:I know I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh it’s wrong.
 Ross:(feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.
 Ross:Let’s also get a hot plate!
 Ross:Hey everybody!
 Ross:Hey uh this is Elizabeth.
 Ross:Oh no-no-no we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)
 Ross:Bye.
 Ross:Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)
 Ross:Yes her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
 Ross:Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!
 Ross:I don’t know Rachel why?
 Ross:Well thanks!
 Ross:Well actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious which is perfect for me right now.
 Ross:Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…
 Ross:Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh a student I don’t know.
 Ross:Yes yes of course what-what would this be regarding?
 Ross:Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course why don’t we go inside?
 Ross:Oh-ooh!
 Ross:Doorknob! Doorknob!
 Ross:Oh okay. What-what about?
 Ross:Spring vacation.
 Ross:(quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes professor Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So I will take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)
 Ross:You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
 Ross:I can do that. Oh-oh what if she gets upset?
 Ross:What the hell are you doing?
 Ross:What?! What? How do you how do you even know its broken?!
 Ross:Joey I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.
 Ross:Do not give him any money!
 Ross:Yes. Yes! Please come in.
 Ross:Oo-oo!
 Ross:Yeah it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually I wanted to finish talking to you about uh spring vacation.
 Ross:Look I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.
 Ross:No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…
 Ross:That! Let’s talk about that.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Huh? Oh-oh it was fine. Uh it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.
 Ross:What’s-what’s the difference?
 Ross:Hey y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
 Ross:I went to Egypt with my dad.
 Ross:Hey I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than Spring break! (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!
 Ross:I’m gonna call her.
 Ross:Well it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means that means wet T-shirt contests guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies waking up next to people you don’t even know…
 Ross:Okay she can’t go.
 Ross:Then what am I supposed to do?
 Ross:Well what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
 Ross:I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!
 Ross:Sure. Sure. Look I don’t I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet but umm hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
 Ross:Are you into crafts at all?
 Ross:Well yeah of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip and-and (notices something) what-what is uh what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
 Ross:To wear in front of people?
 Ross:Is this?!
 Ross:So uh have a great time down there.
 Ross:Yeah. And did you did you pack that bathing suit?
 Ross:It was pretty funny when I when I hid it for a while huh? Anyway umm I-I am worried about that bathing suit not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with no I’m concerned about your health sun exposure.
 Ross:Well if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30 sometimes it’s-it’s get 4 and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:Okay. Cool.
 Ross:Call me!
 Ross: Excuse me?
 Ross:Youre right youre right it is.
 Ross: So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
 Ross:It’s your turn.
 Ross:Wait a minute are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?
 Ross:Totally!
 Ross:Great!
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Oh I love that guy! (Laughs.)
 Ross:(stops laughing) What am I doing?
 Ross:Look don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.
 Ross:Yeah none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
 Ross: Oh my God!
 Ross:You ate my sandwich?
 Ross:(getting upset) Oh-oh really?
 Ross:(jumping to his feet in anger) What?
 Ross:You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
 Ross: (losing control we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
 Ross:MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Rosss scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Yes yes it is. In prison!
 Ross:It took two people to break up this relationship!!
 Ross:I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
 Ross:I fell asleep!
 Ross:It was 530 in the morning and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room trapping Monica Chandler and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh and by the way Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
 Ross:(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
 Ross:That’ll be a neat trick when you’re (looks at the script) when you’re dead!
 Ross:There was just an explosion okay? My hearing would be impaired.
 Ross:Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
 Ross:Oh my God. I mean…
 Ross:Totally.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:What are you guys doing later?
 Ross:(continuing) I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.
 Ross:Come on guys I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
 Ross:Thanks!
 Ross:It-it’s great to meet you Paul.
 Ross:Of course of course Mr. Stevens.
 Ross:Eh-wh—Excuse me?
 Ross:That’s funny. Umm…. (Pause then serious) It’s not funny.
 Ross:Okay. I can I can see that. Umm but I think if you give me umm one chance I can I can change your mind.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:This is—you—(Ross starts laughing.)
 Ross:Okay umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean I mean I’ve been in um relationships in general uh but I have never done it with a student—I mean I not—not it! I mean I mean I don’t—We haven’t done it. Uh I mean I mean we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay okay a joke a joke—lighten the mood. Umm two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
 Ross:And the Irish guy wins the joke!
 Ross:Oh God thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm uh Mr. Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh this is Phoebe Monica and Chandler.
 Ross:Okay umm why don’t we all take a seat y’know? And uh and I’ll get us all some uh some coffees—(He goes to pull out Elizabeth’s chair but Paul steps in)—Yeah why don’t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and you guys can talk about whatever whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler Monica and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)
 Ross:(returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul Elizabeth. (He sets down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
 Ross:Joey?!
 Ross:Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)
 Ross:Okay I’ll just wait for him in here!
 Ross:(coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!
 Ross:What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
 Ross:(incredulous) In your mouth?!
 Ross:You were at the coffeehouse!
 Ross:He is my girlfriend’s father okay? It’s-it’s it’s weird!
 Ross:That was different!
 Ross:This is weird for me!
 Ross:How is that important?
 Ross:Yeah take your time.
 Ross:(to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as…
 Ross:Not all bad.
 Ross:Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
 Ross:No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
 Ross:Yeah well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm uh and just so you know Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife! (Realizes) Oh I’m sorry! (To Elizabeth) It’s unbelievable!
 Ross:You’re back.
 Ross:Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me frankly…
 Ross:God no!
 Ross:Well if it doesn’t matter to her it doesn’t matter to me! (to Paul) Still not yelling!
 Ross:That’s okay I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.
 Ross:Uh yeah I guess—Yeah! I guess so.
 Ross:Ohhh! Kids!
 Ross:That’s okay Rach we’re not liking Ross right now.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Why? What?
 Ross:No no that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on let it go y’know? Stop it! Besides Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father so ah he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils huh?
 Ross:Okay okay. Uh well uh Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.
 Ross:Oh come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know ‘cause-‘cause y’know ‘cause he’s all old and…
 Ross:Really? That okay that’s great.
 Ross:All right look I-I realize it upsets you.
 Ross:But Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.
 Ross:Ohh! A man with a plan!
 Ross:This place is really beautiful!
 Ross:Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs but but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?
 Ross:Ehh I was just I was just thinking about your father.
 Ross:No. No-no uh he just he just really freaked me out before.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh protection. Yeah-no yeah-no that-that-that I forgot.
 Ross:Oh no! Hey-hey I’m the guy! I’ll get it.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:A little bit.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Ohh okay.
 Ross:What are you doing here?!
 Ross:Yeah I recognize the ankles!
 Ross:(under the couch) You and your ice.
 Ross:(before entering) Did you really hear a bear?
 Ross:Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I’m gonna go out this window. (Points to the window next to him.) I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home okay?
 Ross:(to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
 Ross:Okay please-please Paul just let me explain…
 Ross:All right fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)
 Ross:And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics Paul’s flexing.)
 Ross:Oh perfect we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
 Ross:How rude.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Great to see you!
 Ross:How you doing?
 Ross:Okay! You take care!
 Ross:Hey Pheebs what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
 Ross:Phoebe why’d you do it?
 Ross:What?! Why?!
 Ross:I can’t think of anything.
 Ross:Wait a minute is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
 Ross:I guess it could.
 Ross:Well if he’s angry he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
 Ross:Hey remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
 Ross:Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
 Ross:Okay. Well apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
 Ross:Yeah! Anyway I-I still think we should try to patch things up y’know? Like uh maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
 Ross:Oh. (Starts to get his money)
 Ross:All the time?
 Ross:Hey! So uh was he excited about the tickets?
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
 Ross:Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!
 Ross:That’s right!
 Ross:Eh? We’ll show him!
 Ross:Wait a minute is this is this for real?
 Ross:So you two are really serious?!
 Ross:You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be brothers-in-law! (They hug.)
 Ross:Hey-hey Pheebs!
 Ross:Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
 Ross:You told her before you told us?
 Ross:God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
 Ross:Yeah you didn’t get one.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Oh no I have plans with Elizabeth.
 Ross:I’m sorry it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!
 Ross:I don’t know.
 Ross:Wait a minute does-does everyone feel this way?
 Ross:Uh-uh—Wow! Uh I thought you guys were just like making jokes I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean I’m the one dating Elizabeth not you!
 Ross:Yeah yeah you have the ring?
 Ross:(to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
 Ross:What’s-what’s going on?
 Ross:Oh you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building!
 Ross:Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm I I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is the same…
 Ross:No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay look can I can I just-just talk to you for a second?
 Ross:Uh so this play umm what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh…
 Ross:(screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
 Ross:Oh my God you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)
 Ross:Who?
 Ross:What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.
 Ross:Yeah I was but uh she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
 Ross:Y’know maybe she is too young for me. Y’know when I was over there and she was running around with her friends I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.
 Ross:Okay umm bad stuff. Well I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.
 Ross:Hmm.
 Ross:Okay good stuff. Umm well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…
 Ross:No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay honestly no. I don’t I don’t see a big future with her.
 Ross:I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh I hate this part.
 Ross:(in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
 Ross:Elizabeth thank God! I was just thinking about…
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Okay break-up’s still on!
 Ross:What happened you guys?
 Ross:Rach!
 Ross:Hey come on in.
 Ross:Oh thanks. Yeah I really thought we’d be able to make it work but uh I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.
 Ross:I guess so.
 Ross:Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
 Ross:Ohh yeah I already have one.
 Ross:Phoebe.
 Ross:Ohh I don’t think so.
 Ross:That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Phoebe how could you do this to me?!
 Ross:I was not!
 Ross:No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!
 Ross:Ooh I wanna switch to Rachel too!
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:Hey what’s going on?
 Ross:I found a note on my door Come to Monica’s quick bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar.

 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Wow! Happy Monica’s night!
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:Well sure. But I get married all the time so…
 Ross:You okay?
 Ross:You mean we—you and me?
 Ross:Oh good you scared me for a minute.
 Ross:I mean—no it’s just ‘cause it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No but there was some good times.
 Ross:Surely you can think of something good.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
 Ross:My hands?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:(to his hands) Way to go guys. Y’know you-you were really good at the stuff too.

 Ross:No.
 Ross:Okay this is getting a little crazy. I mean I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really really…don’t.
 Ross:Okay Monica. Mon uh what-what you just saw…
 Ross:It is! It is!
 Ross:Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
 Ross:Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!
 Ross:Oh no!
 Ross:And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
 Ross:Guess who? (Enters fully.)
 Ross:Hey I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…
 Ross:Still thinking about it huh?
 Ross:(loosening his tie) Oh who cares?
 Ross:(tightening his tie) And so do I.
 Ross:Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
 Ross:(sitting up) No! (Exits.)
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey here’s a thought.
 Ross:Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
 Ross:Uh Rachel I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.
 Ross:Look uh if we’re gonna do this…
 Ross:Oh I see so everybody wins.
 Ross:Oww!

 Ross:(at the door) And uh Rachel.
 Ross:What can I say you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Oh I’ll have some!
 Ross:Take from me as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
 Ross:Oh my God the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!
 Ross:And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at… (Phoebe rushes in.)
 Ross:Phoebe oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
 Ross:Oh my God! Of course of course. (To the class.) Umm would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you… (Motions that they should learn everyone’s hometown.) (To Phoebe) Wh-what’s going on?
 Ross:Umm okay yeah sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
 Ross:Phoebe you said it was urgent!
 Ross:Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
 Ross:Uh Phoebe…

 Ross:Phoebe you can’t massage people in my apartment!
 Ross:And they knew about it?
 Ross:Look this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!

 Ross:Hello.
 Ross:Uh no-no she-she’s out for the night.
 Ross:Can I can I help you with something?
 Ross:(deadpan) Yes I am.
 Ross:Okay! Now I’m going to touch you. (He does so very gingerly.) Ohh that’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)
 Ross:(sitting down) Hey what are you guys what are you guys talking about?
 Ross:(takes a drink) Damn this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)
 Ross:So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?

 Ross:(looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?
 Ross:(incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
 Ross:Okay so it wasn’t uh a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And and I gently exfoliated him with with a mop.
 Ross:Hey y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.
 Ross:He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right you’re right. I’m sorry.
 Ross:His daughter was hot.
 Ross:About what?
 Ross:Well you-you’ve always had glasses.
 Ross:Are you sure?
 Ross:(entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler what are you doing tonight?
 Ross:No why?
 Ross:My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
 Ross:Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you he asked for Chancy I assumed he meant you.
 Ross:No I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
 Ross:Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:You’re not a lefty?
 Ross:Oh we have to get you an engagement present?
 Ross:No one got me an engagement present.
 Ross:Two! I’ve been engaged twice!
 Ross:(entering with Chandler) Hey.
 Ross:Well I had a great time! Umm Chancy on the other hand…
 Ross:And what did he ask you not to call him?
 Ross:Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
 Ross:‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
 Ross:Now I know you wanted to bond with my dad but did you really have to bond to that part?
 Ross:Oh but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
 Ross:Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
 Ross:You were trying to eat it!
 Ross:Whoa-whoa aren’t you a little over dressed?
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.
 Ross:You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
 Ross:Let’s give it a shot.
 Ross:Ohh these are pretty good.
 Ross:Which one was that?
 Ross:Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) I’m okay.
 Ross:Yeah ooh yeah I think there is one from batch 17 left uh… (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
 Ross:Looking up?

 Ross:That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit I’ve got shuffleboard that day.

 Ross:What you got over there? Tacos?
 Ross:Uhh those are tacos.
 Ross:Eh either way I’ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can’t eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What’s so funny?!
 Ross:(To Chandler) You told her!
 Ross:(To Monica) Look okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said Umm what would make this ride more fun?!
 Ross:(To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
 Ross:Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
 Ross:Well Chandler and I are in a bar…
 Ross:And this girl is making eyes at Chandler okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh after a minute or two I see them kissing. Now I know what you’re thinking Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls and you’re right Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
 Ross:Oh Mon I laughed so hard…
 Ross:Whatever dude you kissed a guy.
 Ross:All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
 Ross:Oh is that funny?! Oh you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
 Ross:Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.
 Ross:Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
 Ross:Ohh! Ohh! In college Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
 Ross:Whatever dude you kissed a guy.
 Ross:And in my defense the cleaning lady came on to me!
 Ross:And! We should keep all the stuff uh we told each other secret from everybody else.
 Ross:Okay (gets up) if you’ll excuse me I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.
 Ross:Man! (Monica mouths I’m sorry.)
 Ross:(To Chandler) Dude that reverse lay-up! Oh…
 Ross:Amazing!
 Ross:Oh you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy we call him Hums While He Pees.
 Ross:It’s not a club.
 Ross:Hey divorced men are not bad men!
 Ross:Soon he’ll be able to call you that lady he knew who got fired.
 Ross:Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.
 Ross:I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
 Ross:I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say I love you and that’s why I have to kill you.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:What?! No!
 Ross:Look I don’t think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)
 Ross:All right! I want my key back!
 Ross:It’s right there! (Points to her hand.)
 Ross:Look I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
 Ross:Oh yeah—No—You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later.
 Ross:Hi Whitney.
 Ross:Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
 Ross:(opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I’m sorry but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman who by the way did not spend the night.
 Ross:Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
 Ross:Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people!
 Ross:Like what?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Pheebs come on! I mean consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now if you’ll excuse me…
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Listen you are hearing one side of the story okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.
 Ross:Well I don’t think we are gonna have that problem but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
 Ross:I think he can be.
 Ross:Well excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
 Ross:(angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
 Ross:So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.) I’m sorry you had to see that.
 Ross:My God!
 Ross:Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
 Ross:Wh-what’s up?
 Ross:Oh just say it Kyle!
 Ross:(To Whitney) Y’know he hums when he pees!
 Ross:It makes him miss the bowl but whatever.
 Ross:That’s all right we-we don’t need you. In fact hey I’m over it already.
 Ross:(To Phoebe) I’m sorry. Ugh Pheebs you were you were right about her. Y’know she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah I hurt my back a little.
 Ross:Yeah were better off without them.
 Ross:Divorced men’s club.
 Ross:Joey we just saw it!
 Ross:And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
 Ross:Dude you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
 Ross:Well John McLane had plans!
 Ross:What happened?!!
 Ross:We fell asleep! That is all.
 Ross:I think that would be best.
 Ross:Okay. But not about this!
 Ross:No touch! No touch!
 Ross:Wow this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
 Ross:Just uh brought back your videos.
 Ross:No! No we don’t!
 Ross:I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
 Ross:I’ve had better.
 Ross:All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
 Ross:I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
 Ross:We can’t do it again.
 Ross:Because it’s weird!
 Ross:Sure what do you got?
 Ross:No 10 is the highest.
 Ross:Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay Rachel you’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1 You’re with Monica the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)
 Ross:Yes very nice Rachel.
 Ross:(playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl I remember that—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
 Ross:It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
 Ross:Go!
 Ross:Yeah it really was!
 Ross:Okay Phoebe I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I really don’t see the point.
 Ross:I’m sorry Rach it was it was really close.
 Ross:Actually it wasn’t that close.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Why-why would I care about that?
 Ross:It really was.
 Ross:(slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
 Ross:Okay okay take a guess.
 Ross:Okay okay I was typing names into the library computer earlier y’know-y’know for fun and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way towards a secluded section behind the racks.)
 Ross:(stopping quickly) Oh umm there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?
 Ross:People are doing it in front of my book!
 Ross:My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school I went to see it and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
 Ross:Let me ask you something at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh fool around.
 Ross:Great! Because people kept showing up I think it’s like uh-a thing!
 Ross:Oh for cryin’ out loud! (He storms out.)
 Ross:Excuse me. Hi I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section fifth floor stack 437?
 Ross:No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)
 Ross:Hi I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well rolling around in front of it.
 Ross:Well fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!
 Ross:Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
 Ross:Oh-oh you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for hmm? Perhaps (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
 Ross:Ah… Ah…Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.) Uh meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?
 Ross:I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
 Ross:I’m a professor here uh Ross…Geller.
 Ross:Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!
 Ross:Well I uh I skipped forth grade.
 Ross:I am very…very sorry.
 Ross:(to the guard) Don’t sweat it I’ve got this section covered. Yeah in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay see you later.
 Ross:(entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
 Ross:What are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
 Ross:What? Thats like insanely easy!
 Ross:What? You forgot fourteen states?
 Ross:Wow how many have you got?
 Ross:Done! With time a-to-spare.
 Ross:You know I hate to lecture you guys but its kinda disgraceful that a group of well-educated adults and Joey cant name all the states. Did you ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe? Hmm?
 Ross:What? Thats impossible.
 Ross:No just give me another minute.
 Ross:This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right uhh I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
 Ross:Youre on!
 Ross:Pshhshhh!
 Ross:Phoebe why is your bag moving?
 Ross:Ohio!! Thank you!
 Ross:What dog? There-theres no dog here.
 Ross:Are you out of your mind?
 Ross:Right they are scary. (He jumps up screaming) Ahh she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
 Ross:Its too cold.
 Ross:(to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
 Ross:How can I not get this? Im a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
 Ross:Damn I forgot you were here.
 Ross:Hey! Whats she doing back here?
 Ross:Hey look Phoebe. I uh I laid out the states geographically...
 Ross:Yeah but but look what Im...
 Ross:Um in Phoebes room. You cant go in there.
 Ross:Monicas crying. Shes very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
 Ross:No. No no. She doesnt want to see you right now.
 Ross:Because you sent away the dog!
 Ross:Oh is it? Is it? Look when Monica and I were kids we had a dog named Rover. And uh one day my dad decides he doesnt like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Dont you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
 Ross:From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter like hes almost crying) Yes please!
 Ross:I hate America! When I finish this game I swear I am moving.
 Ross:Okay maybe this is so hard because there arent 50 states. Let me tell you something I have 49 states and there are no more! I-I think I should be able to eat something.
 Ross:Tag? Y-Youre going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didnt uh we didnt get the chance to talk. Uh so where did you say youre from again?
 Ross:Ah what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)
 Ross:Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
 Ross:(hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!
 Ross:(pauses) I know.
 Ross:You sure?
 Ross:No-no one daddy two mommies. All right it’s all yours. (Ross pushes him off.)
 Ross:Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(shocked) What?!
 Ross:Ohh.
 Ross:That is so unfair!
 Ross:Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!! (Monica runs to make more candy.) Pheebs you uh you got a second.
 Ross:Yeah ever since you uh told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean everyone should have a-a first bike so…
 Ross:You like it?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Ahh.
 Ross:Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh t-take it downstairs y’know give it a test ride.
 Ross:(stunned at the complement) You’re welcome.
 Ross:Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
 Ross:Wait a minute she was walking the bike? Both times?
 Ross:Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?
 Ross:Okay now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…
 Ross:Phoebe you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
 Ross:Well…In-in case of emergency.
 Ross:Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you.
 Ross:Okay Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:I swear!
 Ross:Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right here we go. All right? (They start.)
 Ross:All right. Feel good?
 Ross:All right try pedaling.
 Ross:That’s it your doing great.
 Ross:Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
 Ross:Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
 Ross:I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…
 Ross:It’s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!
 Ross:Hey there’s uh some people outside askin’ about candy.
 Ross:Need some help?
 Ross:By the way the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe’s room.)
 Ross:(entering) Look I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
 Ross:I know. I know. But can we please try it again? Huh? I mean you were so close Phoebe!
 Ross:Phoebe.
 Ross:All right y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry I’m just gonna have to take it back.
 Ross:Because! Because it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.
 Ross:Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You’re making the bike very happy.
 Ross:Oh hey don’t thank me thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:(Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey I just found out I get Ben for the holidays this year.
 Ross:Nope. I mean I know Susan does every year but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.

 Ross:Well how about this year instead of Santa we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

 Ross:Im the holiday armadillo! Im a friend of Santas and he sent me here to wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!
 Ross:(to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
 Ross:Thats right Ben. Im Santas representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But Santa sent me here to give you these presents Ben. (He tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents but cant because of the costume) Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
 Ross:Youre welcome Ben. Merry Christmas ooh and Happy Hanukkah!
 Ross:(gasps) You are? Me too!
 Ross:(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh hey Ben what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
 Ross:What are you doing here Santa?
 Ross:Im the Holiday Armadillo your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
 Ross:(to Chandler) What are you doing?
 Ross:Thank you but but you gotta leave.
 Ross:Because Im finally getting him excited about Hanukkah and and youre-you’re wrecking it.
 Ross:Im sorry Chandler but this this is really important to me.
 Ross:Okay Ben Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
 Ross:Fine I-I give up. Santa Santa can stay.
 Ross:All right its time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
 Ross:…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day burned for…
 Ross:That’s right and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa Superman Monica Ben and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
 Ross:Come on come on we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!

 Ross:Come on come on we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!
 Ross:Well technically it seven billion years ago… (Well technically you’d be able to see it for days well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of New York.)
 Ross:Okay! Okay! Fine I’ll stop! No teaching okay? We’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don’t streak across the sky meteors do.) Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King.
 Ross:Man look at all those stars! (Yeah you can see what? Five of them from the city?) Infinite space. It really really makes you wonder doesn’t it?
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey’s standing.)
 Ross:Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
 Ross:Show me where?
 Ross:(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open?
 Ross:Joey!
 Ross:It’s called the Bapstein-King comet okay? (Joey starts to groan.) Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
 Ross:Rachel!! Monica!!
 Ross:I can’t believe this!!
 Ross:(standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah I guess we don’t have a choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!
 Ross:(To Joey) I know I wasn’t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.) (Yelling at the street) But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!!
 Ross:Ugh. Well we’re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah. Now we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.
 Ross:Yeah! Oh yeah you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.
 Ross:Well I’m gonna lie to you Joey it’s a possibility.
 Ross:Oh all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?
 Ross:Okay. Well you be careful.
 Ross:Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!
 Ross:(looking in the window behind them) Y’know y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window crawl through and-and y’know explain later.
 Ross:I don’t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass which angers the big large angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.) When you get in there… (Joey nods his disapproval.)
 Ross:Okay do-do you have a good grip?
 Ross:Okay I’m going to start climb down you now.
 Ross:Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
 Ross:I would say that.
 Ross:Okay here I go.
 Ross:I prefer not to answer that right now I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
 Ross:So what do you want me to do?
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:(looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
 Ross:It’s still looks pretty far!
 Ross:Do not rush me!!
 Ross:Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I—Ooh a quarter!
 Ross:Hey y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say This is my brother-in-law Ross. Not My friend Ross brother-in-law Ross. That’s weird isn’t it?
 Ross:(disappointed) Sure do whatever you want.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!
 Ross:I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!
 Ross:(on phone) Uh hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes we’re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?
 Ross:I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.
 Ross:They kept your room for a while.
 Ross:Come on you know they love you.
 Ross:I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:What’s wrong with this year?
 Ross:Hey y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Dad?
 Ross:(entering with Monica) Hey!
 Ross:Dad we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.
 Ross:(To Monica) Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
 Ross:Yeah not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
 Ross:Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?
 Ross:Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey check this out dad (reading his grades) Math A. Science A. History A. Gym…(He puts it away and finds something else.) Oooh my rock polisher!
 Ross:It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:How are you ever going to sell this place?
 Ross:Oh no. Dad! Dad! What…(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.) Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad she’s gonna be crushed!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Dad that won’t matter to her. Look all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is is growing new stuff! See this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
 Ross:Well can you blame her?
 Ross:Dad dad I don’t want to hear about it.
 Ross:Well not right now. Okay look Monica came here for some memories and damnit we’re gonna give her some! Okay grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.
 Ross:Like uh y’know like this! This! (He picks up one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could’ve made this!
 Ross:Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could’ve won this!
 Ross:Sure! Ooh-ooh what about this?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:(overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh this will make a great memory.
 Ross:Well these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
 Ross:Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)
 Ross:Oh I don’t know how that got in there.
 Ross:Umm your boxes are umm…
 Ross:Dad?
 Ross:All right. I think it was a mouse.
 Ross:(even more shocked) What?!!!
 Ross:Well w-w-w-w-wait w-wait wait wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
 Ross:Well what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!
 Ross:Happy birthday!!!
 Ross:We’ve got presents!
 Ross:Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
 Ross:Hey 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
 Ross:Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
 Ross:How hot do I look in this huh?!
 Ross:That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
 Ross:(giddy) I don’t know but-but look how shiny!
 Ross:Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
 Ross:Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
 Ross:Okay forward. Forward—Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to the back of the car.) Okay back—Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to the front.) Okay forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!
 Ross:No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine. (The woman walks away.)
 Ross:Maybe that will liven up this party.
 Ross:(to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
 Ross:Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?
 Ross:What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group then goes and sits down.)
 Ross:Which is fine! Because you just turned—(Removes two candles from the cake)—twenty-eight!
 Ross:(To Monica) You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.
 Ross:I really wish that you wouldn’t.
 Ross:Come on!
 Ross:Okay is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!
 Ross:(interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!
 Ross:All right everyone lift! (They and try to lift the car of course it doesn’t raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over but the car still does not move.)
 Ross:God do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?
 Ross:Yes! My baby’s finally free!
 Ross:(starting it) Woohoo!
 Ross:You wanna buy a car?
 Ross:What’s the matter? You okay?
 Ross:Okay. Yeah I guess I guess I could do that too.
 Ross:Yeah I kind of uh have something else planned for you guys.
 Ross:Sorry I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
 Ross:What? A brain transplant?!
 Ross:It’s ridiculous!
 Ross:(to Monica and Rachel) It’s winter they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod knowingly.)
 Ross:Yeah-yeah help me out here when you come out of the brain transplant you are going to be her?
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Oh well it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh rediscover its Scottish roots.
 Ross:Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
 Ross:How did you know about that?!
 Ross:Were you the ones called the cops?!
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
 Ross:No you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.
 Ross:…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
 Ross:(To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
 Ross:(stands up) Now umm remember I’m still learning.
 Ross:One two three four!
 Ross:You know the song! Sing along!
 Ross:So?
 Ross:You know the song! Sing along!

 Ross:Uh before we do uh are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there?
 Ross:(to Ben) Okay! All clear!
 Ross:(to Ben) Everything okay in there?
 Ross:Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
 Ross:Oh she isn’t home.
 Ross:Well Ben would be there.
 Ross:What’s the matter?
 Ross:Rach he’s not an ex-con.
 Ross:I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
 Ross:Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
 Ross:(To Rachel) I wasn’t talking to you.
 Ross:Okay I’ll see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in an hour.
 Ross:I have a bone to pick with you.
 Ross:Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
 Ross:That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
 Ross:Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
 Ross:I was barefoot. Now tell me the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
 Ross:Rachel! What are you doing here?
 Ross:Your good friend?
 Ross:What’s her last name?
 Ross:Nice. And by the way that uh that line down my face?
 Ross:Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh (In a college frat boy voice) Dude don’t you ever was your face?
 Ross:Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Practical jokes.
 Ross:You have a line down your face.
 Ross:Uh y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
 Ross:I will be! Listen I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
 Ross:No that’s not what I want. Uh I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel so…
 Ross:Okay I’ll see you later pal.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That’s great. That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
 Ross:All right that’s it! (He runs over to Ben but he runs past him and out the door.) Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!
 Ross:Wait! No! Ben come here! I am not kidding!
 Ross:I-I-am—(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)
 Ross:(noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh go try to talk to her?
 Ross:Uh yeah! Let me let me get that for you.
 Ross:(exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.) (Calmly) So hi I’m uh I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly waves.)
 Ross:Kristen hi. Are you uh new to the area ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime.
 Ross:Ah.
 Ross:Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talking about.)
 Ross:Umm say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Great! Uh let me take this up for you. (The box he’s holding.)
 Ross:Oh no-no after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When she’s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can’t pick it up.)
 Ross:Laugh all you want but uh she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.
 Ross:Yeah in fact I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)
 Ross:(returning) Hey.
 Ross:Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.
 Ross:Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!
 Ross:Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
 Ross:Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively I think I should date her…
 Ross:That’s interesting but check this out. I date her…
 Ross:Okay okay. This can go on for a while.
 Ross:No Joey! Look why don’t why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.
 Ross:Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…
 Ross:Well sorry that’s what I do on dates.
 Ross:So let’s decide on the spending limit…
 Ross:I was thinking more like a hundred.
 Ross:Hey! What’s up?
 Ross:Oh thanks!
 Ross:We have 800 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
 Ross:I am dressed.
 Ross:I have an oily T-zone!
 Ross:That’s right.
 Ross:Uh actually I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
 Ross:Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
 Ross:Why am I not surprised?
 Ross:I don’t think you have much choice.
 Ross:Bye-bye!
 Ross:Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).
 Ross:So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
 Ross:Hi. (They shake hands.) It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.
 Ross:Yeah. So…
 Ross:So Joey umm you look familiar. Are uh are you on TV or something?
 Ross:That’s right! That’s right don’t you play a woman?
 Ross:Much better.
 Ross:Well yes yes I have. In fact umm just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.
 Ross:That’s right! Wait no Ben.
 Ross:Well umm…
 Ross:Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
 Ross:Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
 Ross:Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
 Ross:Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
 Ross:Probably around gonorrhea.
 Ross:Yeah laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin!
 Ross:…and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis?
 Ross:Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
 Ross:Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn’t know what to make of it.) Of course this is just conjecture. Okay that’s uh that’s all for today. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse can I see you for a moment?
 Ross:Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam I’m afraid I-I had to fail you.
 Ross:Well you need 60% to pass…
 Ross:Seven.
 Ross:No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?
 Ross:Well I’m sorry but that-that’s really not my problem.
 Ross:Well that brings me in the loop a little.
 Ross:Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm I uh I’m your teacher. I’m sorry you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
 Ross:Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
 Ross:There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.
 Ross:I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
 Ross:Yeah! I don’t know. I mean last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? (Rachel and Joey both look at him.)
 Ross:It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
 Ross:Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
 Ross:(turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis how can I help you?
 Ross:And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
 Ross:(turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Well that’s different! Okay? Because he he was actually in love with me!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
 Ross:Uh Mr. Morse can I speak to you for a moment?
 Ross:Uh-hmm yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.
 Ross:‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.
 Ross:Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay—(Ned looks shocked)—Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston Professor Fredrickson I’ll be right with you. (To Ned) Don’t make this worse and I’ll give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)
 Ross:A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
 Ross:Cassie?
 Ross:Wow I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
 Ross:So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.
 Ross:What—why?
 Ross:What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!
 Ross:Fine she can stay at my place. By the way what-what does Cassie even look like now.
 Ross:(shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh. Oh that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.
 Ross:It’s okay. Come come on in.
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
 Ross:Yeah—No!!
 Ross:Cassie how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.
 Ross:(quietly) Thank God.
 Ross:Oh right. Right. Ooh remember the time I uh I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? (She laughs) We’re probably too old to do that now.
 Ross:(looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
 Ross:Well I’m I’m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children would be.
 Ross:(in his head) She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! (She grabs some popcorn.) Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run the sexiest movie ever. (She grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.
 Ross:(in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay doesn’t have to be clever it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause) There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To her) I-I I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his head) Yeah you really shouldn’t have said anything.
 Ross:She seems really really fun!
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:So that’s two of my wives.
 Ross:Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
 Ross:No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux Batman’s tux!
 Ross:That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.
 Ross:So?
 Ross:Well you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
 Ross:Pretty please? Not very uh 007.
 Ross:When I got married you slept with my sister.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
 Ross:Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
 Ross:Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
 Ross:What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!
 Ross:Okay but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
 Ross:Well with Carol I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
 Ross:Well why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm Monica from the moment I met you I knew I loved you.
 Ross:...everyone this is Chandler!
 Ross:(Screaming) I’m getting married today!! Ahh whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh we were helping Chandler write his vows but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
 Ross:How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
 Ross:I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!
 Ross:Phoebe that’s not true.
 Ross:Believe me it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
 Ross:(entering) Whats going on?
 Ross:What?! What?!
 Ross:Actually it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
 Ross:(He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Ross:It’ll be okay Joe.
 Ross:That little naked guy would be me.
 Ross:Yes yes fine that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
 Ross:Got me.
 Ross:Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
 Ross:(looking) Nono that would be me again.
 Ross:(To Chandler) Oh man this is hilarious.
 Ross:(quietly) Dude!
 Ross:Dude! How-how did you write this?
 Ross:You can’t do that!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey uh Mon I saw the Porsche parked out front can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.
 Ross:It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
 Ross:Whew! That was a brisk ride!
 Ross:Only way to fly.
 Ross:You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
 Ross:Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.
 Ross:What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
 Ross:No way!
 Ross:Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter because if I remember correctly there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
 Ross:What do you think you’re doing?!
 Ross:There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?
 Ross:No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)
 Ross:With you?! Yeah right!
 Ross:(grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in but into the back seat.)
 Ross:In the death seat?!!
 Ross:(shocked) You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
 Ross:(grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
 Ross:Okay stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you you are not in that much trouble.
 Ross:I was talking to myself! You’re going down!
 Ross:Yeah I’ll get right on that.
 Ross:No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:Dear Lord!!
 Ross:Here it comes.
 Ross:Well she should it was taken ten years ago!
 Ross:I can handle the stick!!
 Ross:Who?
 Ross:What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
 Ross:Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! (They pull over.)
 Ross:Good evening officer.
 Ross:Ah no. I don’t but it could not have been more than sixty.
 Ross:I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
 Ross:Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…
 Ross:(laughs) You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty?
 Ross:I know. I know.
 Ross:Oh where are you guys going?
 Ross:Ah. Joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?
 Ross:(To Chandler) Y’know what? Actually I’m kinda glad they’re leaving ‘cause uh I need to talk to you about something.
 Ross:Well this uh this may be a little awkward.
 Ross:No its…Its not that. Umm now what I’m going to say to you I’m not saying as your friend. Okay? I’m-I’m saying as it as Monica’s older brother.
 Ross:Not for the next few minutes.
 Ross:Nope.
 Ross:Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn’t be more thrilled for both of you but as Monica’s older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind I will hunt you down and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What? I’m-I’m-I’m serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) Come—Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I’m-I’m not kidding here!
 Ross:No problem.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(walks up) Wow Monica! Hey just so you know I had my uh older brother chat with Chandler.
 Ross:Well I…I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)
 Ross:Thanks you guys. (Walks away happily and his parents smile.)
 Ross:(clinking a wine glass) Can I have everyone’s attention please? I’m uh; I’m Ross Geller.
 Ross:Dad…dad please! As I was saying umm I’m Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh and I’m the best man. And uh this marriage is doubly special for me umm because not only is the groom my best friend but uh the bride is my little sister. And she’s the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you’d all please join me in raising a glass to the the couple we’re here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings.
 Ross:Oh taking my parents back to the hotel.
 Ross:What? Are you going back to work?
 Ross:Nice shades.
 Ross:And if I remember correctly Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
 Ross:Hey where’s Chandler?
 Ross:(going up to Rachel’s closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and looks inside and doesn’t see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still doesn’t find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Is uh is Monica here?
 Ross:I think Chandler’s gone. (He hands her the note.)
 Ross:He left that.
 Ross:I think it means he freaked out and left!
 Ross:Look—Okay I’m just gonna—I’m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out okay?
 Ross:(scared) I will I will find him.
 Ross:Gunther have you uh have you seen Chandler?
 Ross:Oh damn!
 Ross:Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
 Ross:Well then we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks away slowly but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (They’re sitting by the window.) What-what…what you guys doing here?!
 Ross:Why?!
 Ross:(shocked) Gunther?!
 Ross:What? Your-your list?
 Ross:Yes! No-no! I know I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler could you just let him know I’m looking for him?
 Ross:No! I talked to Joey on the set he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!
 Ross:No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure they both think I’m interested in them.
 Ross:No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!
 Ross:Well can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go back to some of the places I went last night.
 Ross:Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
 Ross:Give me two.
 Ross:Okay wish me luck.
 Ross:Why?!
 Ross:We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!
 Ross:That is an old Chinese woman!
 Ross:Aw y’know…Y’know maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?
 Ross:So this is your office?
 Ross:She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know okay? Now come on we’re going home.
 Ross:What’s wrong with being the Bings?
 Ross:Chandler have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
 Ross:Then you are neither of your parents!
 Ross:Y’know okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
 Ross:(interrupting him) Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now that’s not scary right?
 Ross:There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary was it?
 Ross:I’m telling you just a little bit at a time.
 Ross:Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can you can do that too! Just like you’ve done everything else!
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa where where you going?!
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm anyone seen Chandler?
 Ross:He-he was with me umm we’re playing a little game y’know? Hide and seek.
 Ross:(pause) You’re right thanks for keeping me honest dad.
 Ross:Oh my God! Monica!
 Ross:Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.
 Ross:Uh-huh.
 Ross:These-these are beads of joy.
 Ross:Uh Phoebe can I see you for a second?
 Ross:Chandler’s gone again!
 Ross:(turning a corner) There he is!!
 Ross:You’re not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
 Ross:Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) I’m serious! You’re not walking out on my sister!
 Ross:Then where the hell have you been?!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What?! What?! Talking about what?!
 Ross:Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…
 Ross:Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?
 Ross:Dude. (Hugs him.)
 Ross:Huh. This is nice.
 Ross:I’ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can’t end in divorce.
 Ross:Rings?
 Ross:(To Monica) Okay I know I’m not supposed to know but I do. And I’m so excited for you!
 Ross:Monica’s pregnant!
 Ross:What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?
 Ross:No! (Pause) I’ll be right back. (Exits.)
 Ross:Hi. I’m uh I’m Ross. I don’t I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother.
 Ross:Oh! Hello uh Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona wow what a what a beautiful name.
 Ross:Aw come on Mona Lisa?
 Ross:Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
 Ross:Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh uh me too.
 Ross:(sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken.
 Ross:Hey! Uh I thought I thought you were at table six.
 Ross:Oh see before you uh when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh which was misleading. Well I’m… (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.
 Ross:It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.
 Ross:Umm would you like to dance?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
 Ross:I wasn’t farting! (To Mona) Uh a little game from our table. (To the little girl) Yes?
 Ross:Oh umm well uh maybe-maybe later. Right now I’m about to dance with this lady.
 Ross:Uh unless! Unless uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first.
 Ross:Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
 Ross:Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?
 Ross:Keep dancing.
 Ross:No-no thank you Miranda.
 Ross:All right. (Walks over to Mona.)
 Ross:Oh-oh were you were you watching?
 Ross:What? Of course you can! Hop on!
 Ross:I am so gonna score.
 Ross:I like your bow.
 Ross:(to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.
 Ross:No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)
 Ross:Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
 Ross:Oh you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what’s uh what’s your name.
 Ross:That’s that’s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Ross’s feet but he pulls them out of harm’s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
 Ross:Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
 Ross:I’m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
 Ross:Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert’s shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)
 Ross:I just didn’t see the fast song coming.
 Ross:Oh thank you.
 Ross:Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.
 Ross:Thread!
 Ross:What disposable cameras?
 Ross:No you didn’t.
 Ross:Oh-oh yeah you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian? (Chandler laughs.) Yeah then you did that.
 Ross:No. Sorry man.
 Ross:Well I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.
 Ross:In-in three minutes.
 Ross:Chandler?
 Ross:No. Did you?
 Ross:Well I checked in the uh lost and found I talked to the manager no-one’s turned them.
 Ross:Now you guys just got married why is she so depressed?
 Ross:I’m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
 Ross:No-no-no I’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop throw our tuxes back on and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.
 Ross:I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
 Ross:I’m telling you this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?
 Ross:What about the chairs?
 Ross:How about the place settings?
 Ross:What did you do?
 Ross:Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)
 Ross:I heard it. I heard it.
 Ross:Okay. Okay!
 Ross:Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
 Ross:A ’95 LeSabre?!
 Ross:A green LeSabre?
 Ross:I’m sorry I meant a blue LeSabre.
 Ross:Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Now you are going to love these.
 Ross:Huh didn’t see that coming.
 Ross:Well I’m gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.
 Ross:No-no I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month!
 Ross:Hey! How you doing?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Oh hey right back at ya.
 Ross:Yeah. She—Well she’s one crazy lady?
 Ross:(shows Tag his sweater tag) Umm I don’t some Italian guy. Come on read your own label. See you later.
 Ross:He is so weird.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:No why?
 Ross:Oh well I guess I’ll catch up with her later.
 Ross:Oh no.
 Ross:I think I might know what this is about.
 Ross:Yeah. Uh uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
 Ross:Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
 Ross:Well we-we said we’d just do it that one time but but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
 Ross:Why? What-what else could it be?
 Ross:I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?
 Ross:Yeah I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:(quietly confident) I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? (They go inside.) Look uh I know why you’re here.
 Ross:Yeah and to save you from any embarrassment umm I think maybe I should talk first.
 Ross:Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?
 Ross:I mean look that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?
 Ross:Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact I have some time right now.
 Ross:Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
 Ross:I’m good. I’m good.
 Ross:Yeah I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand umm how this happened? We-we used a condom.
 Ross:What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
 Ross:No they don’t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
 Ross:Oh well I may as well have!
 Ross:Freaked out? Hey no I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!
 Ross:No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact (picks up the phone) I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
 Ross:(grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
 Ross:(on phone) Yeah I’ll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to escape.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Sure.
 Ross:Namaste. (Bows.)
 Ross:Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
 Ross:Look is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
 Ross:Yeah but uh… Okay okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together but there’s something else. (Pause) Rachel’s pregnant.
 Ross:With my child.
 Ross:You already know don’t you?
 Ross:Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.
 Ross:Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
 Ross:But hey in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
 Ross:I gotta go find her.
 Ross:Evidently they do.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Uh we-we need to talk.
 Ross:Please please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
 Ross:What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards Rachel’s feet) really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…
 Ross:Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments the uh the Lamaze classes uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.
 Ross:Well yeah I think we should get married.
 Ross:No because that’s the right thing to do.
 Ross:No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.
 Ross:Come on Rach you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.
 Ross:I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
 Ross:When have you ever?
 Ross:Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
 Ross:I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!
 Ross:But not the husband because evidently she can do this alone.
 Ross:(To Rachel standing by her feet) I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me.
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:Pretty amazing huh?
 Ross:What? What?!
 Ross:You-you just said that you did!
 Ross:Oh sure come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh look come here look (rolls the machine closer) it’s-it’s-it’s it’s right there (Points).
 Ross:Do you really?
 Ross:Come on! Come on! Here okay-okay you see this? (Points) This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
 Ross:Sweetie that’s it.
 Ross:You’re welcome.
 Ross:Yeah that’s our baby.
 Ross:Oh hey show them the picture of your uterus.
 Ross:Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
 Ross:Hello!
 Ross:So how was the honeymoon?
 Ross:(glaring at him) Yeah thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)
 Ross:(laughs) Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.
 Ross:The lie you just told.
 Ross:There’s the one!
 Ross:Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.
 Ross:What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
 Ross:Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel just-just drop it.
 Ross:I can show you I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It’s an expression.
 Ross:(entering) Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door!
 Ross:Okay listen I am not a pervert!
 Ross:Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look here’s what happened and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm a personal thing.
 Ross:About…about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn’t had sex in months?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m I’m really uncomfortable talking about.
 Ross:I actually had a topic in mind! I’m I’m kinda going through a dry spell sex wise.
 Ross:Five to be lying six.
 Ross:Well I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
 Ross:Please help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!
 Ross:Really? Well then tell it to me.
 Ross:(sarcastic) I’ll try to control myself.
 Ross:(laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
 Ross:(stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please please you were in Western Europe and?
 Ross:(intently listening) Why?
 Ross:It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
 Ross:Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um yeah I was in Barcelona.
 Ross:Anyway umm so I was um I was hiking…
 Ross:(whines) Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo…
 Ross:Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
 Ross:Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
 Ross:No! No I don’t…don’t want to.
 Ross:I was backpacking across Western Europe.
 Ross:I was just outside Barcelona hiking…
 Ross:It’s been six months! I’m always hot!
 Ross:I’ll try that.
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
 Ross:Listen if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.
 Ross:Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? (Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:That’s less embarrassing yes. Yes I was.
 Ross:(voiceover) So when she came in I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
 Ross:What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
 Ross:Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross You’ll show me right?) No!
 Ross:Joey! No!
 Ross:Look it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened but I swear I didn’t even watch it! Anyway here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)
 Ross:Forget it she’s destroying it.
 Ross:Look forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So end of story.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:I don’t want people to see it for your sake.
 Ross:Rachel please…
 Ross:Fine. Fine but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)
 Ross:(on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
 Ross:(on tape) You didn’t do it?
 Ross:(pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
 Ross:(on tape) I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh you and I almost…
 Ross:(on tape) I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.
 Ross:(on tape) So we…we both wanted to.
 Ross:(on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm it probably worked out for the best.
 Ross:And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.
 Ross:Now I’m so happy.
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Yeah. Listen about that the whole uh who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.
 Ross:It was. It was an amazing night.
 Ross:I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.
 Ross:Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.
 Ross:Good luck.
 Ross:Mind if I mute?
 Ross:Oh oh there go the clothes.
 Ross:Six months Rachel six months.
 Ross:Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.
 Ross:Oh nice tan!
 Ross:Ah….
 Ross:I have been working out.
 Ross:Oh that’s not pretty.
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Oh no!
 Ross:Oh no!!
 Ross:No!!
 Ross:No!!!
 Ross:(running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
 Ross:Oh ah I think you know where I want to go.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Yeah!!
 Ross:I’m telling you I like the food!
 Ross:Did that guy just call you Toby?
 Ross:Well why don’t you correct him?
 Ross:Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
 Ross:(laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M your middle name is Muriel!!
 Ross:Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy your parents never gave you a chance did they?
 Ross:(entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!
 Ross:So what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
 Ross:Rach? You wanna come?
 Ross:A date?
 Ross:Why no it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh regular. It’s-it’s uh it’s mundane. It’s actually uh a little dull.
 Ross:A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?
 Ross:You set her up?!
 Ross:Joey what-what were you thinking?!
 Ross:Joey I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?
 Ross:A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
 Ross:Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!
 Ross:Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.
 Ross:A bit of a daredevil are we?
 Ross:Okay. Have a great time you guys.
 Ross:Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the entire sentence.)
 Ross:Books?
 Ross:Well I tell you what. Why don’t we uh why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie we’ll just hang.
 Ross:Hey if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.
 Ross:I just…I have to find out how it went.
 Ross:This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
 Ross:I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
 Ross:I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.
 Ross:It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.
 Ross:No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
 Ross:It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.
 Ross:No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
 Ross:No it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
 Ross:Hello.
 Ross:Well how was the date?
 Ross:Uh-huh. What happened?
 Ross:Ah he didn’t uh take it so well?
 Ross:Oh?
 Ross:He sounds swell.
 Ross:Hey wanna…wanna a little cheering up?
 Ross:Sit down.
 Ross:Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
 Ross:Yeah-ha!
 Ross:I’m sorry about your date.
 Ross:Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
 Ross:You wanna you wanna grab some coffee?
 Ross:Hey I thought I cheered you up.
 Ross:Right. Good night.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh hi!
 Ross:Wow! Uh…how are you?
 Ross:Oh that’s right. Well uh would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
 Ross:Great! Well umm…
 Ross:Sure! Uh let me get it for ya.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Well I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…
 Ross:(exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah I think I will.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:That’s right! He was hitting on her and I got her. I guess the better man won. (To Joey) Please don’t take her from me.
 Ross:(entering) Hey! (He’s wearing a costume as well.)
 Ross:Remember the Russian satellite Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well I’m a potato or a…spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that he’s wearing.) So Sputnik becomes… (They’re still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!
 Ross:No I-I’m not doody.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You made it!
 Ross:Well I’m a spud…
 Ross:Yes!
 Ross:That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
 Ross:Uh in her defense she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
 Ross:Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!
 Ross:Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
 Ross:Pride.
 Ross:(To Chandler) So you gettin’ tired?
 Ross:Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin’ a little tired though.
 Ross:Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona Mona’s standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
 Ross:Hey at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody.
 Ross:Come on who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’.
 Ross:(celebrating) Oh yeah!
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)
 Ross:I think it’s coming from your bag.
 Ross:So apparently I’m available for lunch.
 Ross:You’re moving?
 Ross:So does-does Joey know you’re moving?
 Ross:That’s not really porn.
 Ross:Hey y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
 Ross:Well I don’t know but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel looks at him.) With your permission.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Yeah. No. No you’re right.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.
 Ross:I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh thank God!
 Ross:Of course! Uh yeah she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)
 Ross:Y’know I would it’s just painful.
 Ross:Thanks for the coffee or bedankt voor de koffie Gunter. (He translates that phrase into Dutch.)
 Ross:Yeah we’re done.
 Ross:Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
 Ross:Really?!
 Ross:Sweet!
 Ross:Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
 Ross:No-no I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
 Ross:It’s not for me it’s for Rachel.
 Ross:Yeah but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.
 Ross:Yeah you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?
 Ross:(finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!
 Ross:Damnit!
 Ross:Hi. How is she?
 Ross:(happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh I brought her some bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)
 Ross:Oh I don’t know that it would.
 Ross:All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
 Ross:Well the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!
 Ross:(stutters looking for words) Ezels!!
 Ross:Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
 Ross:Yeah a lot of my students do that.
 Ross:Okay I-I’ll see you tonight.
 Ross:Okay bye.
 Ross:Ah it’s good. It’s going good. I mean we get along great. She’s she’s so…
 Ross:Well I was gonna say sweet but yeah-huh!
 Ross:Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off y’know?
 Ross:Sure one year is paper but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his agreement.)
 Ross:Uh actually sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.
 Ross:Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
 Ross:So much more.
 Ross:Aw forget it it’s from Pier One. (There’s an angry knock on the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)
 Ross:Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
 Ross:Who did?!
 Ross:Yes. Yes yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
 Ross:No! No sir umm she means a lot to me. I mean I care—I-I love Rachel.
 Ross:(to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a like a friend.
 Ross:(to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!
 Ross:(To Mona) But I didn’t want to.
 Ross:I’m sorry. Dr. Green Mona. Mona Dr. Green.
 Ross:I was going to tell you but…
 Ross:Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The phone rings and Ross goes to answer it only he’s trapped behind the apothecary table by Dr. Green.) Can I just… (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don’t we just let the machine get that?
 Ross:No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to I need to lie down.
 Ross:So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!
 Ross:I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!
 Ross:Rachel!
 Ross:Okay!
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:Thank you so much for coming back over.
 Ross:Focus.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Trying to date this woman.
 Ross:Probably shouldn’t touch me.
 Ross:Should I leave this open for you too?
 Ross:Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
 Ross:I know and I was going to but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake but it’s only because I really really like you. Really!
 Ross:(entering) Will!
 Ross:Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?
 Ross:Yeah you too. Man so-so what are you up to?
 Ross:Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
 Ross:Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh Lance Davis’ graduation party.
 Ross:Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in but still real fun.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(laughs) Yeah.
 Ross:So how long are you in town?
 Ross:Aw—oh that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
 Ross:Will high school was-was a long time ago.
 Ross:No need to point she knows who Ross is.
 Ross:No. No.
 Ross:Uh actually there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.
 Ross:That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.
 Ross:Look Rach I-I’m sorry okay? I…I was a stupid kid okay? The only reason I joined…
 Ross:…co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
 Ross:No-no! No-no. No-no.
 Ross:It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
 Ross:Actually Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.
 Ross:Rach I think you’re reading a little too much into it.
 Ross:Look what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!
 Ross:Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Hey! She didn’t look 50!
 Ross:She didn’t photograph well!
 Ross:I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…
 Ross:Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in the club!
 Ross:As a romancer of the elderly.
 Ross:The eyes…did still sparkle.
 Ross:Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Nope.
 Ross:That’s right I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.
 Ross:Bye.
 Ross:Yeah. Why?
 Ross:Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.
 Ross:Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
 Ross:What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
 Ross:Uh I actually haven’t even met him.
 Ross:Well actually I’m picking Ben up tomorrow maybe he’ll be there.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…
 Ross:I dropped him off at Carol’s. (To Phoebe) Anyway it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.
 Ross:Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.
 Ross:Apparently Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.
 Ross:Phoebe you can’t force kids to be friends.
 Ross:Playpen?! Ben’s seven!
 Ross:Look I’m sorry Pheebs I can’t do it.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Look Phoebe I’m sorry it’s just…
 Ross:Phoebe I…
 Ross:You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)
 Ross:Well…let’s just say… (singing) Rosss caaaaan!
 Ross:Uh middle balcony.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Oh great! Hey-hey Joey do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
 Ross:Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
 Ross:Wow! That is a good one! Wow it looks like a like a holiday card y’know with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
 Ross:(pause) Together? Like-like to people?
 Ross:Okay. (Not happy about it.)
 Ross:Uh sure sure.
 Ross:I know. Can you believe that?
 Ross:Married couples send out cards families send out cards people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Huh. Wow this is great.
 Ross:Well we-we haven’t said that to each other yet but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
 Ross:A hundred?! Well I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh card thing.
 Ross:Sending out a holiday card together I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Huh.
 Ross:Hmm…
 Ross:Let’s do the card!
 Ross:The card! I think we’re there!
 Ross:Really?! I mean even with the card?
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Oh yeah yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!
 Ross:Yeah we’re not just doing a card! Y’know she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
 Ross:I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman So where is this going?
 Ross:Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.
 Ross:Smaller than that.
 Ross:Uh bigger than that.
 Ross:Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
 Ross:Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet but I could say I looove spending time with you.
 Ross:Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
 Ross:Here we go. Mona umm I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
 Ross:Aw we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more but decides there isn’t.)
 Ross:I mean there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you not you you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?
 Ross:Well well to sum up we’re having fun you look young.
 Ross:But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment. (Hands her his key.)
 Ross:Really.
 Ross:Not just a key I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
 Ross:Oh great I live on the street.
 Ross:Okay and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
 Ross:No. That guy is.
 Ross:I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
 Ross:I love you!
 Ross:Hey! Oh I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
 Ross:Professor Neuman the head of the department so….
 Ross:No I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn’t I get head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)
 Ross:…which brings us back of course to Greely’s theory of dominance. (The bell rings.) Okay that-that’s all for today. Oh uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
 Ross:What?! That-that’s all the way cross town I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
 Ross:Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!
 Ross:Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I’m sorry I’m a little late. Ah—(Checks his watch)—Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh by introducing myself I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up I’m Professor Geller. Good job today.
 Ross:No I ran. It was really far and when did people stop understanding the phrase Get the hell out of my way!
 Ross:Ugh between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides I teach the class three times a week who am I? Rockefeller?
 Ross:Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.
 Ross:You’ve seen it the Geller Yeller.
 Ross:Besides I-I think I figured out a much faster route I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)
 Ross:Yeah!!!! Yes I made it! I’m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a student takes a drink and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay why don’t we all uh (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where… (Exhales again) Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay (Closes his book.) umm why don’t why don’t you all start to read while I—(Passes out and collapses.)
 Ross:Phoebe!!
 Ross:So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time he’s wearing in-line skates and hasn’t taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map somewhere in the Middle East then spins on the skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs…
 Ross:Right.
 Ross:No-no we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.
 Ross:And smart!
 Ross:With an aptitude for science.
 Ross:Really? Me too!
 Ross:Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup you know? Uh Rach-Rach what were you thinking? (Gives her a look)
 Ross:Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
 Ross:Well OK it’s for a boy. Well I know it’s a little out there but…Darwin.
 Ross:You’re just saying that cause I said no to your name!
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:That sounds fair.
 Ross:Veto.
 Ross:Rain? Hi. Hi my name is Rain. I have my own kiln and my dress is made out of wheat.
 Ross:Okay how about for a guy Thatcher?
 Ross:Fine you go.
 Ross:Huh.
 Ross:Oh veto. How about—Ooh I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
 Ross:Veto. Stewart?
 Ross:Veto. Helen?
 Ross:I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean come on little Ruthie Geller how-how cute is that?
 Ross:Uh no. No we’re not.
 Ross:No no we want to wait right?
 Ross:What? Rach! Come on that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.
 Ross:Yeah why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it. (Rachel starts to peek at the file) Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!
 Ross:You’re looking!
 Ross:I saw you!
 Ross:Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
 Ross:No no no no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!
 Ross:Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Rach I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!
 Ross:I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
 Ross:Veto.
 Ross:Unless… (Rachel groans.) You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
 Ross:Not like this!
 Ross:So I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
 Ross:That’s right. The student has become the master.
 Ross:Oh come on you know it’s a girl!
 Ross:You really didn’t know?
 Ross:No.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
 Ross:I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!
 Ross:Permission to veto.
 Ross:(from outside the bathroom) Hello?
 Ross:(entering) Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh cool boat—(Sees why the boat’s there)—Oh no. (Averts his eyes by looking around the room) (To Rachel) Hey did you did you tell them?
 Ross:(crying) I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!! (Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachel’s belly.)
 Ross:Hey when-when was it kicking? What happened?
 Ross:My God the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.
 Ross:Look I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
 Ross:(rushes in) Is everything okay?
 Ross:Your page said come to the hospital what? What was it? What happened?
 Ross:Oh. Oh. Thank God most women don’t even feel them.
 Ross:Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
 Ross:No I—Mona!
 Ross:What? Why? What’s wrong?
 Ross:No really you tell me what’s up.
 Ross:(To Joey) So thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
 Ross:Yeah but still I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.
 Ross:Hey uh I brought you some lunch.
 Ross:Well yeah!
 Ross:What?! What?! Rach what?!
 Ross:I made her favorite tuna salad with pickles.
 Ross:(to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?
 Ross:I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!
 Ross:Yeah? Not to you because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
 Ross:So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
 Ross:No! No it’s not. Joey this is a smart idea.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)
 Ross:Oh I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah she’s been away all week visiting her parents but she’ll be cool. I mean she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says ‘Fossils are my friends.’
 Ross:Uh I’m going to take off.
 Ross:What is it?
 Ross:All right. (reading the label) ‘Candy and Cookie?’
 Ross:Hey what’s behind your back?
 Ross:You don’t want my opinion?
 Ross:Come on I’m your older brother ask me!
 Ross:(quietly) The red one.
 Ross:Hey! (they hug) So how was Atlantic City?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Wha—? Oh come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?! (Mona laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know most people think this is made with sea water but it’s actually made with uh salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.
 Ross:I do too! I missed you!
 Ross:Oh it was good! It was good. Actually the baby started kicking!
 Ross:Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.
 Ross:Yeah I’m missing out on all this other stuff too. So Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(not amused) Huh…uh-huh.
 Ross:(with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs but turns his head and starts to break down)
 Ross:I don’t know she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um plus she uh she got me taffy!
 Ross:Ever?!
 Ross:Oh no no no I will! I just want to butter her up first! You know I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff and then just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
 Ross:Well I’m uh going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
 Ross:Y’know it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater when in fact—
 Ross:(opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m um supposed to pick you up!
 Ross:(he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like…)Ayyyayyyy!
 Ross:I have no idea!
 Ross:Uh…lately she just likes hanging out here.
 Ross:I think she’s lonely.
 Ross:I know.
 Ross:No no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
 Ross:Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional but but ballsy.
 Ross:And you thought she was going to be in our way! So why don’t you uh open the champagne and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.
 Ross:(fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)
 Ross:(handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.
 Ross:Hey hey man!
 Ross:Uh…Mona just dumped me.
 Ross:Well with everything that’s been going on lately I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know I uh I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner you know?
 Ross:Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on huh? Girl trouble?
 Ross:Really?!
 Ross:Oh sorry. Well look maybe I can help you with it.
 Ross:Hey whatever it is I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know actually once—once I got dumped during sex.
 Ross:Anyway so uh so what is it?
 Ross:C’mon! Joey! What is it?
 Ross:Hey hey it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?
 Ross:She’s not a Tribbiani?
 Ross:I knew it. So is she someone from work?
 Ross:Well uh does she like you?
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:So uh this guy she used to go out with is uh… is he still in love with her?
 Ross:Okay. Um… is he a good guy?
 Ross:Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
 Ross:Joey it’s worth finding out. I mean if you really like her.
 Ross:Okay Joey you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you huh? You owe it to yourself.
 Ross:I’m going to…uh…I’m going to um put the bourbon in it at home.
 Ross:Anyway… seriously uh…just…just talk to the guy okay? And tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until…)
 Ross:So uh this guy she used to go out with is uh… is he a good guy?
 Ross:Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
 Ross:Joey it’s worth finding out. I mean if you really like her.
 Ross:Okay Joey you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until…)
 Ross:(closes the door) Did you um—I’m sorry did you just say it’s Rachel?
 Ross:Um you…you like Rachel?
 Ross:Rachel?!
 Ross:But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
 Ross:It’s not a big deal? Oh I’m sorry I just…um I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?
 Ross:Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
 Ross:Y’know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
 Ross:(stops) I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Oh y’know I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out only weirder!
 Ross:Oh my God! What if what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
 Ross:Sure because women never like Joey. Y’know I think he’s a virgin.
 Ross:He’s not?
 Ross:Why?
 Ross:Hate him? I… No I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s just it’s Rachel y’know?
 Ross:Okay. Okay I’ll talk to him.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:No I don’t want to hit you.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:No no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)
 Ross:Uh…yeah sure. (Enters.)
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:What?! You’re in love with her.
 Ross:Umm no.
 Ross:I think you need to tell her how you feel.
 Ross:No I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is because if she’s not where you are then you can start to move past this.
 Ross:If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
 Ross:Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
 Ross:So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
 Ross:I’m understanding but let’s not get carried away.
 Ross:Yeah tell me about it. (He stands up turns his back to Joey and enjoys another sip.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down like a like a faded salmon?
 Ross:Faded salmon color.
 Ross:Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!
 Ross:That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
 Ross:I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up jump up my own ass and die. (Walks away.)
 Ross:Mona? (There’s no answer so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay if I were a salmon shirt where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
 Ross:Hello!!
 Ross:Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
 Ross:(on phone) Item J437-A color winterberry. (There’s a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm listen come here come in. (She does so.) I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’s just that I… (He picks up the pink shirt.)
 Ross:You do?
 Ross:(faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right.
 Ross:(laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
 Ross:Sure. Yeah.
 Ross:Uh yeah you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
 Ross:Okay hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Aww that is so cool.
 Ross:(picking up Chi-Chi’s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
 Ross:You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
 Ross:Ah actually I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.
 Ross:Well there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.
 Ross:So uh he seems like a nice guy.
 Ross:Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
 Ross:Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
 Ross:That’s a good question dad. That’s a good question…
 Ross:Wha—What?
 Ross:Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?
 Ross:Can you believe that?
 Ross:No us having to lie about being married.
 Ross:Hi Aunt Lisa Uncle Dan
 Ross:We love marriage!
 Ross:Hey
 Ross:I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?
 Ross:(imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry…(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
 Ross:That depends how much did you hear?
 Ross:What was wrong with Mona?
 Ross:Yeah baby!
 Ross:No no it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
 Ross:Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side) Umm…. what are you doing?
 Ross:Okay okay. Ooooh ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
 Ross:Well um actually I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies her favorite flower…
 Ross:Then Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words Will you marry me?
 Ross:Oh no Mom it’s just Monica this year.
 Ross:No of course Um… Um everybody? Um I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride Rachel (She turns around and smiles) and myself. Umm that if…if in 35 years we’re half as happy as you guys are we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
 Ross:…and then we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
 Ross:But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?
 Ross:Yeah! And! And it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:I know I know it was stupid.
 Ross:No actually I thought about it when when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh I would ask you to marry me.
 Ross:It’s a good thing I didn’t do it because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay good night
 Ross:Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?
 Ross:That’s all I’m askin’
 Ross:Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.
 Ross:Hey! All that stuff you said about true love you were right I mean we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Why’d you say no?
 Ross:Just then or-or all the time ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.
 Ross:Shhh! We’re not talking.
 Ross:Uh double latte extra foam.
 Ross:(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on its fun!
 Ross:Are you serious?!
 Ross:Wow! We are pretty good at this!
 Ross:Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
 Ross:It tastes like feet!
 Ross:Are you kidding?
 Ross:(leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
 Ross:Yeah so far nothing stupid.
 Ross:Uh no no just-just that he is a great guy.
 Ross:Yeah you too.
 Ross:All right Ive been feeling incredibly guilty about this because I wanna be a good friend and damnit I am a good friend. So just just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).
 Ross:Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
 Ross:Your make-up!
 Ross:Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
 Ross:I would say that.
 Ross:Okay here I go.
 Ross:I prefer not to answer that right now I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
 Ross:It really was.
 Ross:Hi Jill.
 Ross:Amazing! Amazing!
 Ross:Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
 Ross:Did you just wink at me?
 Ross:Oh cool!
 Ross:Well do you want some help?
 Ross:Awesome!
 Ross:(simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!
 Ross:Well uh I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh…
 Ross:I’m sorry I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
 Ross:The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh I’ll take another question.
 Ross:It’s okay I’m ready.
 Ross:(exhaling) The fear of Triscuts!
 Ross:It’s possible they have really sharp edges.
 Ross:Wait a minute I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
 Ross:Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:(To Chandler) You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…
 Ross:(excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler) Haaa! (To Joey) I’d like a Wicked Wango card!
 Ross:(thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay I know this give me-give me a second!
 Ross:Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
 Ross:I’d like to spin the wheel!
 Ross:Is there a hopping bonus?
 Ross:Ben Franklin.
 Ross:Queen Victoria.
 Ross:Noooo!!! Every time!!!
 Ross:Yeah!!
 Ross:(entering out of breath) Hey!
 Ross:I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
 Ross:Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
 Ross:(excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
 Ross:Uh what?
 Ross:What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.
 Ross:Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
 Ross:Well we…we don’t have a garage.
 Ross:Y’know what? Maybe Mrs. Green it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.
 Ross:I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.
 Ross:Well uh y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time by myself.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:That’s a different issue. Uh the point is when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
 Ross:Yes! Yes you’re gonna be so missed.
 Ross:Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)
 Ross:Oh come on every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn’t believe that.) Hey! You will! Uh look y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?
 Ross:Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.
 Ross:I’m telling you.
 Ross:Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
 Ross:You sure?
 Ross:All right then. (Gets up in an announcer’s voice) Rachel Green! Let’s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
 Ross:Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
 Ross:That’s correct! This is an audio question what do you do when the baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
 Ross:Excellent! Excellent now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
 Ross:Oh I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I’ve lost sight of why we’re doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)
 Ross:Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the table.)
 Ross:No Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all gasp.) I didn’t want her to see it so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)
 Ross:Umm…
 Ross:But the good news is no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
 Ross:Yeah they all know.
 Ross:(startling him) What?! What?
 Ross:Are ya?
 Ross:What are you doing up?
 Ross:Okay look I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…
 Ross:It’s funny you should mention diapers.
 Ross:Okay look there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
 Ross:(interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh if you’re gonna do this then I’m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So… (Starts for the bathroom.)
 Ross:(annoyed) Yeah!
 Ross:(stunned) (thinks) Well uh…
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:We are having a baby together but we’re not involved. (The cashier a very beautiful woman looks confused) I mean uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at him angrily) Or yes stranger we’d like this delivered please.
 Ross:Oh okay.
 Ross:I chose those I’m a paleontologist.
 Ross:Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
 Ross:That’s my gym.
 Ross:I am like Indiana Jones.
 Ross:My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answers it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh what are you doing here?
 Ross:Ah must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
 Ross:Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
 Ross:Oh! Wow! Uh yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (The money) back in my pocket pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah actually I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…
 Ross:(To Katie) Yeah I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh and my whip. (Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not because I’m-I’m into S&M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’m not-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is uncomfortable.) So I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so leaving Katie and Rachel alone.)
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:How are you?
 Ross:Uhh it was fun. We we just had coffee.
 Ross:What’s uh what’s going on? Do you not do you not like Katie?
 Ross:I liked her.
 Ross:Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
 Ross:Why? What was wrong with her?
 Ross:Okay so what’s the matter?
 Ross:(laughs) Why? What what are you jealous?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:I won’t date. I’ll uh I’ll be here with you all the time.
 Ross:True but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.
 Ross:Do you feel better?
 Ross:Uh Rach?
 Ross:Just one thing umm…
 Ross:We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?
 Ross:Oh-oh Rach! I was just messin’ around! (She’s stunned) Like you did last night when I had to pee?
 Ross:(pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…
 Ross:…that you actually…
 Ross:Rach?
 Ross:The bathroom?
 Ross:Hey! What are you guys looking at?
 Ross:Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
 Ross:Now I cannot wait to see this.
 Ross:Uh sweetie maybe you’d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the green armchair.)
 Ross:Look I-I know how miserable you are I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it’s the male they carry the babies. And then also umm I’d be far away in the sea. (He sits back down.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
 Ross:Rach we gotta go.
 Ross:People ask me why we’re not together I just don’t know what to tell them.
 Ross:Uh do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us but if you hurry…
 Ross:Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. (She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
 Ross:Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Uh-huh.
 Ross:Mmm?
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.
 Ross:Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon why don’t we not speak until then.
 Ross:Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!
 Ross:(to Rachel) Oh you’re nice to her.
 Ross:Do them!!
 Ross:You’ve got to be kidding me!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Yeah we tried them all. We went for a walk uh we tried a special tea caster oil spicy food nothing has worked.
 Ross:It’s sex.
 Ross:Monica!
 Ross:Monica what is the matter with you?
 Ross:What?! While she’s been going through this hell you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Can I get some of that action?
 Ross:Come on finish your enchilada.
 Ross:Okay here have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot! (Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
 Ross:Stop it.
 Ross:I’m sorry but we have to have some boundaries! My God I’m dying.
 Ross:This is insane I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.
 Ross:Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.
 Ross:I love when you talk dirty to me.
 Ross:Okay enough! This is this is not going to happen.
 Ross:Y’know what?
 Ross:Forget it.
 Ross:I’m getting that baby out of you!
 Ross:Oh I know.
 Ross:I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:We’re having a baby.
 Ross:Not so much.
 Ross:All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
 Ross:No but come on we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast but this has got to be some kind of a record!
 Ross:Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
 Ross:N… No! We took a cab too but I did test runs!
 Ross:Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
 Ross:Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi this is Rachel Green. I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:I really think they’re out of rooms.
 Ross:Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble you don’t know where any countries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by Rachel.) Uh say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?
 Ross:What-what?
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:Yeah guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He’s looking at the stirrups on the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his legs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.
 Ross:Hi! Hi I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.
 Ross:Hi Julie.
 Ross:This is Rachel. (Points at her.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Umm say I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.
 Ross:Oh okay.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh. Okay just breathe.
 Ross:(simultaneously as Rachel) We’re not gonna do that.
 Ross:Uh yes! Thank you.
 Ross:Later.
 Ross:Oh uh I’m sorry. (Runs out.)
 Ross:Hi! I’m so glad you’re here but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.
 Ross:Oh good.
 Ross:Okay what’s up?
 Ross:Ma you’re asking me to marry you?
 Ross:Mom no come on! Thank you.
 Ross:N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant okay?
 Ross:Mom y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…
 Ross:Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters the hallway.)
 Ross:…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.
 Ross:Are you kidding? Look we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?
 Ross:Okay stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey. Who’s that?
 Ross:What happened to the Disgustingtons?
 Ross:Wow! Sorry. So uh how are the new people?
 Ross:Yeah? Okay.
 Ross:Umm. Umm I’m-I’m just gonna—(Closes the privacy screen.)
 Ross:No-no I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)
 Ross:Just ignore them.
 Ross:What? What?
 Ross:(to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
 Ross:The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.
 Ross:That’s it. That’s it.
 Ross:Just three?! I’m dilated three!
 Ross:Actually it’s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)
 Ross:Uh Rach…
 Ross:And yet somehow it’s true!
 Ross:(To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
 Ross:(softly) Really?
 Ross:Oh there you go!
 Ross:No-no. We…
 Ross:Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh uh that’s all.
 Ross:Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place y’know? But we’re very excited about this.
 Ross:Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Not just Janice Janice in labor contracting and everything.
 Ross:Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
 Ross:Sweetie you’re doing great.
 Ross:What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!
 Ross:What is that?
 Ross:Oh thank God I thought she had two heads.
 Ross:Go!
 Ross:Yes you can!
 Ross:Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!
 Ross:No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready? 1…2…3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking him down.)
 Ross:(from the floor) Keep pushing!
 Ross:You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!
 Ross:Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!
 Ross:Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.
 Ross:Oh she’s…she’s perfect.
 Ross:Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.
 Ross:Oh come in.
 Ross:The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus you-you’re sleep deprived.
 Ross:Uh actually we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.
 Ross:Wow! Umm okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel starts crying.) What?
 Ross:Umm Delilah.
 Ross:So I guess we’re back to uh Baby Girl.
 Ross:Ugh easy for you to say you already know what your kids names are going to be.
 Ross:(entering) Hey Janice!
 Ross:Who’s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)
 Ross:No-no. No.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again y’know?
 Ross:I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?
 Ross:Oh my God! I’m sorry I was talking to this nurse completely forgot.
 Ross:Yeah. She’s putting her down now that’s her. (Points to the nurse putting Emma now.)
 Ross:Look at Emma!
 Ross:Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous it’s all Rachel.
 Ross:It’s…it’s complicated okay?
 Ross:Look we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart and then together and then apart and now we have a baby. (Pause) It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything—(Starts to cry.) Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really we’re doing really well right now.
 Ross:Yeah exactly.
 Ross:Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.
 Ross:You’re weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.) (To Rachel) Listen I uh wanted to talk to you about something.
 Ross:Uh Joey can you give us just a minute?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Hey where’s uh where’s mom?
 Ross:Uh Dad Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.
 Ross:What about Ben?
 Ross:Oh well yeah actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
 Ross:Yeah right.
 Ross:What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
 Ross:Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!
 Ross:I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
 Ross:(noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s head to look at Emma.)
 Ross:Wow! Kind of uh kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)
 Ross:Dad what are you doing?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:What that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Phoebe there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.
 Ross:(pause) I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
 Ross:No! No come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.
 Ross:What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!
 Ross:I didn’t give her that ring!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:It’s mine.
 Ross:Yes!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:No!!
 Ross:Look. Look my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.
 Ross:Look I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket assume that I was going to propose throw it on and-and just start telling people?
 Ross:Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause) Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Listen I um… I heard about the engagement.
 Ross:And confused. Rach sweetie I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.
 Ross:I don’t think you do.
 Ross:Poor baby you’re so tired. Rach I didn’t propose to you Joey didn’t propose to you and Chandler didn’t propose to you.
 Ross:Joey proposed to you?
 Ross:Hey wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey did you propose to her?
 Ross:Wait! Whoa-whoa you…you gave her the ring?
 Ross:Whoa! You were down on one knee?
 Ross:Then what did happen?
 Ross:Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa you saw her breast?!
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Uhh… No.
 Ross:But I-I was going to see if y’know maybe you uh start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all Rach.
 Ross:No you didn’t!
 Ross:(To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!
 Ross:Hey I’m not going to rush into anything!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
 Ross:Good weird?
 Ross:We’re so lucky.
 Ross:Look I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Okay well that… Wow okay well umm…then maybe at least we can we can talk about us again.
 Ross:Well good okay. I-I kind of think y’know if we…if… You’re wearing the ring.
 Ross:And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
 Ross:When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?
 Ross:You said you’d marry Joey?
 Ross:So you said yes to him and you just had our baby?
 Ross:So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again you were engaged to my best friend.
 Ross:Well Chandler’s my oldest friend but Joey’s my—No! Ah! (points at Rachel)
 Ross:Rachel said she’d marry you?!
 Ross:(enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
 Ross:In the closet.
 Ross:Linen closet.
 Ross:In the hospital.
 Ross:No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.
 Ross:Sure what kind?
 Ross:Please take your time it’s an important decision. Not like say I know! deciding to marry someone this is about a muffin.
 Ross:Blueberry it is.
 Ross:Hey Gunther can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)
 Ross:Yep.
 Ross:Yep can you believe it?
 Ross:Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a… Huh?
 Ross:Ah actually we don’t. (Ross walks off)
 Ross:(turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!
 Ross:Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) accidentally picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again) accidentally proposed to Rachel.
 Ross:And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel but why couldn’t you tell me huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.
 Ross:Not using it right Joe.
 Ross:I’m gonna go.
 Ross:Give me the bag.
 Ross:Joey!
 Ross:I’m not gonna hit you.
 Ross:No I don’t.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Give me the bag.
 Ross:Give me the bag.
 Ross:Joey give me the bag.
 Ross:Joe I’m not kidding…
 Ross:No!
 Ross:You ducked!!
 Ross:Oh my god this really hurts!!!
 Ross:What is the matter with you?!?
 Ross:Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
 Ross:I broke my thumb.
 Ross:You know what you can go I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but can’t)
 Ross:Why does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)
 Ross:Just Ross!
 Ross:You know my birthday.
 Ross:October 18th.
 Ross:Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
 Ross:Ah Rachel I guess.
 Ross:Just ah… just put roommate.
 Ross:I don’t think that we are.
 Ross:Well I thought so too but then she said she’d marry you.
 Ross:Yeah that’s what she said.
 Ross:So I don’t wanna be just anybody.
 Ross:You know what it’s it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Yes. I mean it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a plan you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello? (Pause) I’m fine.
 Ross:Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Ah I had a little thing with Joey if you think this is bad you should see him.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:What Rach?
 Ross:(smiles) Right.
 Ross:Well that’s what I’m here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want me to get that?
 Ross:Hey! So whats the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
 Ross:Oh my God!

 Ross:Rachel I can see you dialing! I dont understand why...
 Ross:(Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!
 Ross:Rach you cant call people at three in the morning.
 Ross:Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
 Ross:Well what was it?
 Ross:Rach I told you you cant call him every time any little thing comes up.
 Ross:Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know I dont think thats a good idea. In fact I think hes dead.
 Ross:Rach I promise first thing tomorrow well find another doctor but I gotta get up early and Im not feeling all that well.
 Ross:You know? Come to think of it it does feel Rubella-like! (Walks back into his room.)
 Ross:(Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!
 Ross:Thanks doctor.
 Ross:You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!
 Ross:Hey!

 Ross:umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
 Ross:well he seemed to bum hard that youd never been in a serious relationship.
 Ross:well Phoebe I think youll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)
 Ross:Good yeah just be honest with him.

 Ross:So so is Mike coming to dinner?

 Ross:Can�t hold her own head up but yeah jumped.
 Ross:Rach you did not leave the water running. Please just pull yourself together okay?
 Ross:You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in �609 - TOW Ross Got High� first aired 1999-11-25.)
 Ross:Oh my god you know what yeah I think you�re right. I think � listen listen!
 Ross:A pigeon a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No no wait no-no an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby seeing this jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird�s aid. The eagle however misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip swirling around the whirl pool that fills the apartment.
 Ross:Great. So let�s get going?
 Ross:Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
 Ross:I�m so sorry �
 Ross:And then Rachel wasn�t sure she could leave the baby.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Thanks. Oh.
 Ross:Y�know this ??? is incredible.

 Ross:Boy we uhm... hadnt really thought of that.
 Ross:Oh come on Rach we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
 Ross:She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while but then gets a gotcha expression on his face... Theres knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay okay. This ones name is Sandy. Shes got a degree in early childhood education uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
 Ross:And shes a little mannish...
 Ross:Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)
 Ross:(skeptic) So youre just like a... guy whos a nanny?
 Ross:(on a yeah right tone) Okay.
 Ross:Yeah kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)
 Ross:Oh come on Rach hes a guy!
 Ross:Because its weird!
 Ross:What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-Its like if a woman wanted to be...
 Ross:King?
 Ross:You gotta be at least bi...
 Ross:(very worried) Is everything allright?
 Ross:And Im fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a why do you say that manner) Rach can I... can I see you for a sec?
 Ross:Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I havent cried that many times since I moved in.
 Ross:(picks up a cookie) Okay okay see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
 Ross:(speaking with his mouth full) Yeah I mean all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!
 Ross:This... this is exactly what Im talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies huh? Theyre not even... butch manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)
 Ross:Hey... theres sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
 Ross:Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
 Ross:Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
 Ross:(looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But thats not the point. (Joey now also enters)
 Ross:Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:...a what? A what? Whats the end of that sentence?
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
 Ross:Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like Can you believe that?)
 Ross:Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross What are you doing?)
 Ross:Yep! Thats my thing...
 Ross:Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
 Ross:(looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)
 Ross:Okay okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
 Ross:(shakes his head) Oh my God!
 Ross:Oh Im sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
 Ross:Well you know what... I-Im sorry Im the only one who isnt in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I cant... I cant go through with this.
 Ross:No! Hey you know what? Im sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...

 Ross:Here goes...
 Ross:Sandy... Hi we uhm... we kinda need to talk. Im afraid its not working out.

 Ross:Anyway uhm...Well Im glad theres no hard feelings.
 Ross:No you know its uhm... nothing you did its... its uhm... my issue.
 Ross:You know Im just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy whos as sensitive as you.
 Ross:Why... I... I dont know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
 Ross:I mean uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasnt the athlete I am now.
 Ross:I play squash...! Anyway uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
 Ross:It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... What are you doing with those things? Whats wrong with you why arent you... why arent you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
 Ross:I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when its summer and its hot why cant you wear a tank top?
 Ross:Here come some more...
 Ross:And thats why no matter what mommy says we really were on a break. (baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! Youre just a... a little bitty baby you know that? But youve got... (in a softer voice) Youve got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the Bs) Big baby butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers cant deny / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist / and a round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God Emma... youre laughing!

 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
 Ross:Yeah and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emmas laugh but it comes out very squeaky very high pitched. He laughs about himself but then looks at Rachel realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) Only... only not creepy.
 Ross:I uhm... Well I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachels face changes from excited to angry)
 Ross:But you know what if you think about it it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
 Ross:Please dont take her away from me!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh I know isnt it? Ooh... whatd you do to get her to laugh?
 Ross:You sang Baby Got Back didnt you?
 Ross:She sweat wet. got it going like a turbo vette.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Hell yeah!
 Ross:Shake it!
 Ross:Shake it!
 Ross:Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees their friends standing in the doorway)
 Ross:Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
 Ross:A lot of people are thankful for those.
 Ross:Hey Amy.
 Ross:That was me.
 Ross:Sure we dont live there but...
 Ross:I know I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
 Ross:Dont say that.
 Ross:Sure you want to go upstairs?
 Ross:You know I think thats a great idea. Itll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
 Ross:Ok fine but I dont want them bonding to much. I dont want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
 Ross:Emma.
 Ross:Well we havent offically asked them yet but we would want Monica and Chandler.
 Ross:well.. its just. its just in that case then um. Emma would go to my parents.
 Ross:Yeah and wed want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
 Ross:No you both are equally capable. Its just.. youre strongest when.. when youre together.
 Ross:Sure Monica would have to give her up.
 Ross:Hey dude you okay? Sorry about before.
 Ross:Emma.
 Ross:Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
 Ross:So so now do I get Joey?
 Ross:Youre really not coming back?
 Ross:I cant get *enough* dinosaurs!
 Ross:You got me a cola drink?
 Ross:Well this this is too much I feel like I should get you another sweater.
 Ross:Ooh hey Ben what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
 Ross:What are you doing here Santa?
 Ross:Im the Holiday Armadillo your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
 Ross:(to Chandler) What are you doing?
 Ross:Thank you but but you you gotta leave.
 Ross:Because Im finally getting him excited about Hanukkah and and youre-youre wrecking it.
 Ross:Im sorry Chandler but this this is really important to me.
 Ross:(in a low voice) Answer faster answer faster!
 Ross:(in the same low voice) Answer better answer better!
 Ross:Really? Youre not gonna return it?
 Ross:Wow it really is!
 Ross:Oh my god...
 Ross:What you you really quit your job?
 Ross:Oh hey...
 Ross:(reading off his card) A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet. -- How did you know?
 Ross:Hi guys.
 Ross:Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesnt she look cute?
 Ross:I think shes gonna be the hit of the office huh? Shes gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
 Ross:Yeah after you punched that one guy who got it wrong word spread. 
 Ross:Good one Rach.
 Ross:Rach we have a code brown situation.
 Ross:Alright but you have to do one sometime.
 Ross:What? No thats illegal. Im gonna have the labor department down her so fast they wont even...
 Ross:What about Emma? We dont have a nanny.
 Ross:Absolutely. Just give me your breast and well be on our way.
 Ross:Fine fine. (To Emma) Well have fun wont we? Yes we will yes we will. (Gives her a kiss and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:So you have to tell Monica you dont want to have a baby right now?
 Ross:(Hugs Chandler) Good-bye.
 Ross:Yeah and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
 Ross:I dont feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
 Ross:Pants off Bing!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
 Ross:Heres an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
 Ross:You know what? I dont need a tie. I mean its better open collar. You know its more casual (He leaves.)
 Ross:Hey you guys!
 Ross:Uh good news everyone we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points to Molly). Molly Chandler Joey.
 Ross:Ooh somebodys getting a little fussy.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Eh I mean I mena shes not unattractive but hot? I ....

 Ross:Whazzup??
 Ross:Listen can you do me a favor? Im gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
 Ross:Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter the hot nanny.
 Ross:You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man Im sure hell lose interest in a week or two but for now can you please just do this for me?
 Ross:Well we gotta do something ok? Nannies like her dont grow on trees. (pause)
 Ross:I am yes.

 Ross:Molly ah do you mind giving us just a minute?
 Ross:Thanx.
 Ross:What do you think youre gonna do have sex with her right here on my couch?
 Ross:Yeah come on in. Molly?

 Ross:Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
 Ross:OK you...you really dont know what I am talking about?
 Ross:OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
 Ross:Right thats why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony
 Ross:Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on thats fine!
 Ross:No Im serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I dont care but...at least she could have told me. You know
 Ross:I dont know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
 Ross:Well and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
 Ross:Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
 Ross:Thats funny...Do you think youll ever work again?
 Ross:I cant believe Rachel just moved on and didnt say anything to me
 Ross:No no about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
 Ross:No. When he called I...I threw the message away.
 Ross:You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
 Ross:You dont have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us like college remember? You...you break the
 Ross:Dont you have to be at work?
 Ross:Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question Would you...
 Ross:Hi! I could help not notice but thats an unusual necklace
 Ross:Right so thats a firm no. I cannot believe this I just keep striking out.
 Ross:This is great. Rachels gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and Im gonna die alone.
 Ross:I know! (he stands)
 Ross:But what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
 Ross:Uh-ah!
 Ross:(pfew). Good choice Ross.
 Ross:Oh yeah hello well now here I am.
 Ross:Oh yeah yeah that�s Michelle.
 Ross:Oh just this woman I�ve been seeing.
 Ross:Yeah didn�t I mention that? Yeah I mean we haven�t being going out for too long but rather there is this
 Ross:How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh I am sorry Michelle that�s
 Ross:I told you about my daughter.
 Ross:I told you it wasn�t long but there is an amazing connection between us.
 Ross:Are you kidding?
 Ross:We�ll see.
 Ross:I don�t know are we just kissing guys on balconies?
 Ross:Through the magic of sight! I was here putting our child to sleep...
 Ross:When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know for what? A week?
 Ross:Ok Michelle it�s time to go.
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:You know if it�s meant to be I�ll guess it. Bye bye.
 Ross:Oh I am sorry did you not like her because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
 Ross:Oh really!
 Ross:Oh really!
 Ross:What about the guy from the bar?
 Ross:The guy you gave your number to.
 Ross:Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
 Ross:I never gave it to you.
 Ross:I don�t know.
 Ross:Who am I?
 Ross:I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!
 Ross:None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
 Ross:Uh clearly.
 Ross:Yeah maybe not. So what you wanna do?
 Ross:Hey youre not naked! So hey Rach when will we expect to see you tonight?
 Ross:Bye! Hey I hope Emma isnt making it too hard on you.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Yeah thatll do it.
 Ross:Im Im okay.
 Ross:Sure I mean do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know Im disappointed but its not like its a divorce.
 Ross:No its not a divorce it is not a divorce! Anyway I think Rachel and I need to you know get on with our lives maybe maybe start seeing other people.
 Ross:Yeah sure why not? In fact if you know anyone that would be good for me...
 Ross:Yeah? Any names come to mind?
 Ross:Excuse me is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height dark hair perhaps doing a puzzle?
 Ross:Well if Im still here in an hour buy him a drink on me.
 Ross:Nah I dont know if I should. I dont wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
 Ross:Yeah its no big deal. Its just a blind date.
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Eh if it was meant to be its meant to be.
 Ross:Wow free crab cakes. Well thats nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
 Ross:Just the crab cakes.
 Ross:Whats - whats going on?
 Ross:What? You - youre making money off my misery?
 Ross:This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now if youll wrap up my free crab cakes Ill be on my way.
 Ross:Hey whats wrong?
 Ross:Oh. Crab cake?
 Ross:Well what happened?
 Ross:Monica told me you had a blind date.
 Ross:I did too.
 Ross:But is it technically a date if the other person doesnt show up?
 Ross:Why does everyone keep saying that?
 Ross:That bad?
 Ross:Female body inspector? What size is that?
 Ross:The first date weve had in months and they were both such disasters.
 Ross:Wait a minute; you dont think it was intentional? I mean thats just stupid.
 Ross:I know. A double blind date and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
 Ross:So uh what kinda stuff do you think theyll have you do there?
 Ross:You know if I didnt already have a job I think I would have been really good in advertising.
 Ross:Yes I did I did! (He turns to Joey disappointed) I should have written it down!
 Ross:Oh I cant. Ive got a date with that waitress Katy yeah I know weve been only going out like twice but I have a really good feeling about her. 
 Ross:(taken aback) What?
 Ross:O-ok. Just relax Phoene just stay calm. (He searches his coat and freaks out). Oh my god I cant find my wallet. 
 Ross:(still in a high-pitched voice) What do you mean no? I knew youd be my death Phoebe Buffay. 
 Ross:Yeah a real pleasure.
 Ross:(shocked) Oh my god. Phoebe you used to mug people? 
 Ross:Hey youll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!
 Ross:(sitting down) Yah because Phoebe knew the mugger! 
 Ross:You wanna know how she knew him? (He points at Phoebe) Because Phoebe used to mug people. 
 Ross:Well anyway it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him because (menacingly) I was about to do some serious damage! 
 Ross:Yeah it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marcs Comics… you know I-I-I was just there minding my own business you know seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week- 
 Ross:Anyway I was heading towards this bakery you know to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone… (He looks at Monica) … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says Gimme your money punk!
 Ross:I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book Science Boy
 Ross:A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
 Ross:Well I-I better get to class (He stands up) Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way Phoebe?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:No one ever asked me that whats wrong? 
 Ross:Oh… (He looks positively surprised) Well uhm there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…
 Ross:(disbelieving) Wh-What are you talking about? It wasnt a girl. It was this huge dude.
 Ross:No it wasnt.
 Ross:No it wasnt. You dont think I wouldve defended myself against a fourteen year-old…
 Ross:(shocked) Oh my god it was you! I cant believe it you… you mugged me? 
 Ross:Its not the best!
 Ross:(indignant) Theres nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. 
 Ross:(interrupting) Hey lets not do this! 
 Ross:Sure go ahead. Whoops sorry sure go ahead. (He raises his hands as if being mugged)
 Ross:(faking enthusiasm) Oh my god crap from the street? (She smiles excitedly but Ross just turns back to his newspaper) 
 Ross:Oh my god. (He sighs) I never thought Id see this again. (He browses trough the pages) Its all here. What made you save it all these years? 
 Ross:You really thought Science Boy was worth saving! 
 Ross:Still… this is amazing… Oh my god thank you Phoebe. 
 Ross:Youre welcome. 
 Ross:(entering) Hey uhm Phoebe didnt by any chance mention that…
 Ross:I see. You didnt happen to tell…
 Ross:Great. Thanks! (He leaves)
 Ross:I cant believe you guys are moving in together. Thats thats great! I mean...Im happy for you guys..
 Ross:Phoebe I had no idea you were so conventional.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh great now youre seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
 Ross:Why?
 Ross:Never?
 Ross:wow are you still going to move in with him?
 Ross:Yeah marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
 Ross:No Im sorry. Look I dont think thats what you wanna hear right now but I cant help it. I love marriage.
 Ross:If you have to call me name I prefer Ross the Divorcer. Its just cooler. Look I know my marriage isnt exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. Im sorry.
 Ross:But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
 Ross:Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before and you know what? You should be. Its a big deal!
 Ross:The Divorcer to the rescue!
 Ross:Yeah I just hurt it.
 Ross:Hey! What do you guys think about this. Ross The Divorce-Force.
 Ross:Hey Pheebs you know Im im really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
 Ross:Good good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it the more I realised I dont think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
 Ross:Well I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
 Ross:I dont know youd be so bored with marriage. I mean its so... normal.
 Ross:Hey hey can I help?
 Ross:You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
 Ross:Oh yeah let me just finish this.
 Ross:Have you seen this? Its a new alumni website for college! Its cool! You can post messages for people let everyone know what youre up to.
 Ross:Its actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
 Ross:Uh uh... well her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
 Ross:No... I already e-mailed her.
 Ross:You know what? Im gonna finish this later ok? Let me just grab my coat.
 Ross:(he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
 Ross:(he comes back) Alright lets go!
 Ross:I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
 Ross:(yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
 Ross:That only is not funny its physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species Id have to have a six foot long... (pause) Its not funny!!
 Ross:I cant believe you put that on my alumni page!
 Ross:Youd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
 Ross:Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
 Ross:(visibly upset) Im dead?
 Ross:Posting that I died? That really isnt funny.
 Ross:Oh please hit by a blimp?
 Ross:Unbelievable my classmates are gonna think Im dead my professors my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. Youre messing with peoples feelings here.
 Ross:Youve really crossed the line here but thats okay its ok cause Im on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. Thats right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
 Ross:uhu uhu check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
 Ross:Eh..actually no I dont need to because your little Ross is dead joke didnt work ok there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website nobody called my parents so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called nobody wrote anything nobody cares that Im dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that Im dead!?
 Ross:What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didnt get one response! And Im dead!
 Ross:I cant believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
 Ross:Youre right. There isnt a decent outlet.
 Ross:Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
 Ross:No! That would be stupid! Youre having it for me!
 Ross:oh too late too late! Its sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
 Ross:Its been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
 Ross:Ok ok! Im gonna go hide! Oh this is so exciting my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
 Ross:Who is he?
 Ross:I dont remember him but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
 Ross:(coming in) Im dead and no one cares?
 Ross:It isnt ridiculous look around! No ones here!
 Ross:Yes youre right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean I went to that school for 4 years I didnt have an impact on anyone?
 Ross:(sceptical) Yeah...
 Ross:(he bounds into the lounge room) But you didnt! Im still alive!! Kori I know this is a big surprise for you. Its a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
 Ross:Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
 Ross:(on the phone) No Mum Im not dead. I know its not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me but its over ok? (pause) Actually no even if I had died you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?
 Ross:No thanks!
 Ross:(in a mocking voice)Uh...sure I do and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
 Ross:The woman just vanished!
 Ross:No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
 Ross:Seriously you guys I cant believe youre going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery I mean thats such a bunch of boohaki.
 Ross:Oh oh we think Emma is about to start talking so were trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
 Ross:(yelling to Monica)Theyre towing your car theyre towing your car!!
 Ross:(panting)Theyre towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
 Ross:Yeah uh... and then I figured after you win we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
 Ross:(to Monica)Think he washed his hands?
 Ross:(mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
 Ross:(mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
 Ross:You know what Im sure your wish is gonna come true but you guys - just in case maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp stops because its very hot) Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
 Ross:Uh youre not gonna win.
 Ross:Ok Ive heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
 Ross:Why would I eat my own arm?
 Ross:Why?
 Ross:You dont have to do that Ill pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - thats so sweet! Come here (they kiss and hug)
 Ross:I dont know probably just invest it.
 Ross:Oh Im sorry did I say invest it? I meant be cool and piss it all away (Joey and Chandler pleased)
 Ross:(to Rachel) Uh how long until they announce the numbers Mommy?
 Ross:Oh Ive gotten into the habit of calling Rachel Mommy when were around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
 Ross:Although if were gonna do that we should probably call me Daddy too.
 Ross:I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
 Ross:(tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I cant.
 Ross:I cant believe this I thought we were all in this together!
 Ross:3 minutes ago!!! I dont know why thats important ...
 Ross:Than I want mine too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win Im gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
 Ross:(trying to stop her) Hey hey!!
 Ross:Monica!
 Ross:Go go go!!
 Ross:Weird.. your psychic didnt mention anything about the scary pigeon...
 Ross:Oh yeah its a good idea!
 Ross:(on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember youre daddys little girl... (covering the phone to Rachel) Phoebes totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to Rachel)
 Ross:Oh we have one too!!
 Ross:(calling Rachel) Come on!!
 Ross:Oh yeah no no no...thats great!
 Ross:Oh Rach...oh...gleba is not a word.
 Ross:Okay what does it mean?
 Ross:Im just Im just glad I didnt miss my daughters first words (goes back to checking the tickets).
 Ross:Yes you did gleba is a word!
 Ross:Ok use it in a sentence.
 Ross:Its not a word!
 Ross:Oh oh ok great. You know what while youre at it she said another word the other day why dont you why dont you look up pbbqqt....
 Ross:Shes gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head very moved)
 Ross:Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
 Ross:Phoebe you dont have any of the first five numbers.
 Ross:I guess if everybody else is...
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Id love to!
 Ross:Phoebe what happened?
 Ross:Oh dont worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
 Ross:Well this is what happens when people live on the edge!
 Ross:Uh dont you think that would be a little weird? I mean two guys in a romantic inn...
 Ross:(browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
 Ross:(in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
 Ross:Yeah I ate all my gifts for everybody.
 Ross:(high pitched voice) Check again please!
 Ross:Not there.
 Ross:(mumbling) She doesnt know what to say!
 Ross:Totally insane. Dude lets drive home well hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if theyre closed maybe well tap a tree and make some ourselves.
 Ross:Dude dont worry bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel you know plenty of amenities we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one Im... I take six!
 Ross:Cmon you get the idea ow-ow-ow well make our money back in no time!
 Ross:I think its the sugar could you hold the apple?
 Ross:(on the phone) Hi this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush toothpaste razor mouthwash deodorant dental floss band aids shaving cream after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I havent asked for already? (pause) Yeah go ahead send up some tampons.
 Ross:What did you get?
 Ross:Nice put it with the others.
 Ross:We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive I love being in the country!
 Ross:Oh thats not cool.
 Ross:No Chandler you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example hair drier no no no but shampoo and conditioners yes yes yes. (pause) Now the salt shaker is off-limits but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish Id thought this through.
 Ross:Not my first time in a hotel my friend.
 Ross:No no no you cant take the remote control!
 Ross:Lets celebrate with some maple candy!
 Ross:At least tell me where you hid it.
 Ross:Oh dude dont worry about it I found an unattended maids car. Were way ahead of the game.
 Ross:Oh my god.
 Ross:Theres something new in the bowl.
 Ross:No but I want...I want the pinecones!
 Ross:Its not the same.
 Ross:(to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
 Ross:Oh my maple candy!
 Ross:(sounds excited) Hi you guys! whats going on you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
 Ross:Yeah it does sound interesting I mean to listen to a woman complain for two hours I dont think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring faking to fall asleep)
 Ross:What? How come that you dont have to go!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey you guys wont believe what I have to do for work today.
 Ross:(covering with his hand Chandlers face like pretending hes not there) (to Monica) Therere these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
 Ross:Its I just know theyre gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
 Ross:(looking his elbow where theres a patch) These arent suede.
 Ross:Hi hi Im Ross Geller.
 Ross:Oh oh thats thats thats nice.
 Ross:Oh no its no big deal I mean if I werent doing this Id just you know be at the gym working out.
 Ross:Oh ha I wrote that in one minute.
 Ross:(hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going you know we got a lot of ground to cover.
 Ross:I dont think so.
 Ross:Oh well hes obviously late and the rule in my class is if you cant come on time then dont come at all. (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?
 Ross:You know what hes a big boy Im sure hell find us ok?
 Ross:Oh damn it!
 Ross:(very bored he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So where did you get your undergraduate degree?
 Ross:(to Charlie) Oh its not over!
 Ross:So basically all nuts?
 Ross:Ive lost the will to live.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh... ok fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk or run or prance or stroll...
 Ross:(entering with Charlie) Oh hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie this is Phoebe and my sister Monica.
 Ross:Yeah Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Ranions theory of species variegation?
 Ross:Oh my God shes great! I mean we-we have so much in common and shes just cool and funny...
 Ross:Really? Wh-whats wrong?
 Ross:Im sorry Rachel this is Charlie Wealer shes a collegue.
 Ross:(looking at them) Wh-whats going on?
 Ross:No I arranged that...
 Ross:(to Charlie) So eh... its probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston huh?
 Ross:Ooh... so sad... Still it cant be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
 Ross:You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
 Ross:... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean thats like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
 Ross:Eh you think? I mean you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
 Ross:(very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused but smiling) Oh Im sorry I dont mean to pry... its just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch Access Hollywood.
 Ross:Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
 Ross:(a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Dont tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
 Ross:Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasnt won the Nobel Prize?
 Ross:Oh yeah? no no Nobel Prizes for him?
 Ross:Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
 Ross:(sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine Im going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
 Ross:She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God at the chinese restaurant earlier today I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
 Ross:Of course you would your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man I cant compete with the guys she goes out with they are so out of my league! oh my God!
 Ross:Oh much much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) Can we walk? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh you... you like that?
 Ross:What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
 Ross:Nice to meet you.
 Ross:Oh Im no actor Im a professor of palaeontology.
 Ross:Oh well no but I mean she only goes out with really really smart guys.
 Ross:Id lead with that.
 Ross:Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
 Ross:Its actually a 1000000$ prize.
 Ross:Yeah maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers Ive written were widely discredited.
 Ross:And sexy.
 Ross:Yeah youre right thanks Pheebs Im gonna go find her.
 Ross:Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
 Ross:(to Rachel) Hey Rach have you seen Charlie anywhere?
 Ross:Im smarter than him!
 Ross:Hey I thought Id end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
 Ross:Yes she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
 Ross:Why do you care so much?
 Ross:Oh I dont know they seem to have a shared interest in each others tonsils...
 Ross:Yeah its no big deal. I mean I just met her and Im fine with it...
 Ross:Oh God. I forgot how hot she was!
 Ross:Im gonna get some more coffee.
 Ross:Ok. (they both go)
 Ross:Uhm no! Think less of you! No I dont think less of you. I mean you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean those people who like someone and dont kiss them... those-those people are stupid I hate those people.
 Ross:Yeah I know the type.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:(annoyed) Oh do you do you really?
 Ross:Look if you dont know what the word acrimonious means just dont use it!
 Ross:Get to the problem!
 Ross:(looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
 Ross:You were saying you didnt want to seem stupid.
 Ross:You know I really dont want to get involved in you guys relationship.
 Ross:(after a short hesitation) Fine.
 Ross:Ok. Lets see. Oh you should take her to the MET!
 Ross:Oh no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Ross:Yeah most of it its a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
 Ross:Yeah uh uh ok theres this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patricks Cathedral and there theres this great little pastry shop that shed love.
 Ross:But Im not! (pause). You know what if youre in the mood for Thai food...
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:Ok when you walk in the museum take the right thats the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt Mesopotamia up to the Byzantine Empire.
 Ross:Now do you have any idea what you just said?
 Ross:Ok now remember when you get to the museum Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
 Ross:Yeah yeah that means... you know? We just... we dont have time for this.
 Ross:Ok but you know what? I gotta say Im really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
 Ross:Wow. What does that mean?
 Ross:Ok! So lets move on to the Renaissance?
 Ross:Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing and dude you cant touch the paintings.
 Ross:No! (Slaps his hand)
 Ross:Haha! Got ya! Die die die!
 Ross:(recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully professor R. Geller. (hits <return> closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!
 Ross:Hey how was the Met?
 Ross:Yeah? Joey really knows his art huh?
 Ross:What do you mean?
 Ross:(perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met did you go to the right?
 Ross:(shaking head) Oh Joey Joey! But still I mean it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What I mean a little but no what go on.
 Ross:(slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean hes a great guy and sure he doesnt know that much about art but you know you can always talk about that with someone else.
 Ross:And if you think about it I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know thats the kind of guy Joey is.
 Ross:That was going to be my next argument.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Glad I could help man.
 Ross:(entering) Hey you guys!
 Ross:Guess whos up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
 Ross:Yeah right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well why are you laughing?
 Ross:Professor Sherman yeah. Ive a meeting with him today.
 Ross:Yeah well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
 Ross:Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
 Ross:Wait a minute you guys. Oh I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do Id love for you guys to come and hear me.
 Ross:Its in Barbados.
 Ross:So-so what did the doctor say?
 Ross:How do you feel about all this?
 Ross:(puzzled) What?
 Ross:(looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
 Ross:The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
 Ross:(reading from a notepad) I mean weve been accepting Leakeys dates as a given but if theyre off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean not just in palaeontology but if-if you think about it in evolutionary biology uh genetics geology uh I mean truly the mind boggles!
 Ross:Oh thats not what you want...
 Ross:Joey! Hey I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
 Ross:Im meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
 Ross:It could be better! He uhm... he fell asleep!
 Ross:Barbados.
 Ross:What am I supposed to do? Hes out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
 Ross:I cant! If he realizes that Im the one that put him to sleep I wont get the job!
 Ross:(To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
 Ross:Oh thats right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. Were going to a conference in Barbados right?
 Ross:(to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
 Ross:Ok I gotta say. I mean it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And Ive a surprise uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! Thats right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
 Ross:Oh right because hes a scientist!
 Ross:Ok we gotta go yeah? So well see you guys tomorrow.
 Ross:Its a blanket Joe not a cloak of invisibility!
 Ross:(very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
 Ross:Wow! This is very flattering uh...
 Ross:Uh uh... Sure! Uhm... Dear... (he takes the notepad)
 Ross:... Sarah. I dig you Uh? Doctor Ross Geller.
 Ross:Yeah oh and Sarah... Id like to introduce you to my colleague uh Professor Wheeler a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
 Ross:Dude its just Days of Our Lives... theres no the.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:(Excited) Youre never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
 Ross:Yeah she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
 Ross:Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
 Ross:(to Charlie) Ready to go?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(a little embarassed by their conversation) Im good I have dinner plans (moves away from them).
 Ross:Uh Joe have you looked outside?
 Ross:By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
 Ross:Oh and you know what it will be even better tomorrow because I wont be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door Ross goes to open and its Joey Rachel and Chandler).
 Ross:The chocolates arent here yet.
 Ross:If you want to check your email just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)
 Ross:Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
 Ross:What oh my God. What did you do?
 Ross:Why why would you open it?
 Ross:What did it say?
 Ross:What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone Chandler!
 Ross:NO! I dont!!
 Ross:Yep! Id like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
 Ross:Yeah well you should! I mean nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean shes never even won a major tournament!
 Ross:Get out! (Chandler runs out)
 Ross:Well what do you do?
 Ross:I cant believe this. I cant believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
 Ross:I dont think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now Joe!
 Ross:Wha... what you really think we can do that?
 Ross:Alright ok lets do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm and then then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era the breakup of Pangea hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then theres the... eh... theres the overview of the Triassic.
 Ross:Yeah thats it?
 Ross:Oh my God we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
 Ross:Yes but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing thank you thank you so much. (he leans in and they look at each other for a moment) Thats a pretty necklace.
 Ross:Hey what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
 Ross:Oh my God I love you.
 Ross:Thats Ben my son from my first marriage.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:No. (they clink glasses and drink)
 Ross:(embarassed) Oh it was... its complicated you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
 Ross:Ok odd thing to get excited about!
 Ross:Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
 Ross:My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didnt get any fitter.
 Ross:I know! Its like if you knew why didnt you tell me you know? I mean call or leave a note Hi I just dropped by to say your wifes gay
 Ross:And then you try to make the best of a bad situation so you float the idea of a threesome?
 Ross:(embarassed) Me neither.
 Ross:Yep we got it we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.
 Ross:Good night.
 Ross:(from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin guys!
 Ross:Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
 Ross:Finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered Gigantosaurus Argentinasaurus...
 Ross:And thats just the herbivores. Im not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
 Ross:But all kidding aside in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
 Ross:... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
 Ross:(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
 Ross:Oh thanks guys!
 Ross:Oh!
 Ross:(with a frozen smile on his face realizing somethings wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now were just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
 Ross:Oh thank you so much!
 Ross:(puzzled) Ok!... All right thanks! Thank you so much you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh I cant tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
 Ross:(skating over embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
 Ross:Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh I cant tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
 Ross:No its ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
 Ross:(joking) Id better not found you naked in my hotel room!
 Ross:(realizing his joke wasnt so good but still giggling) Look I took it too far!
 Ross:Ooh well. Ah I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now not that I wouldnt love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)
 Ross:Get Out!
 Ross:Yes please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So whats going on?
 Ross:Oh my God wh-what happened?
 Ross:I knew that was him!
 Ross:(holding her hand) Hey you ok?
 Ross:Oh professor Clerk were kind of in the middle of a conversation here.
 Ross:(standing) Ok gentlemen! Please! Arent we a little old for this? I mean were scientists right? Were academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO GO GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know we as a group are not the coolest.
 Ross:I dont think they saw us.
 Ross:(apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
 Ross:I think I know too but Ive been really wrong about this stuff in the past so...
 Ross:Im sorry... we... we cant.
 Ross:I mean you just went out with my best friend and I just think itd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)
 Ross:... finally...
 Ross:God youre amazing... I didnt even have to ask you to call me that.
 Ross:Weh...*sigh*
 Ross:Yeah Its just... I dont think I can do this...
 Ross:No NO! (theyre moving to the side of the bed where they sit down) Look I need to talk to Joey. I mean you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us I need to know hes okay with it.
 Ross:Alright Im gonna go find them... (twitches a bit looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay I see you later.
 Ross:Hey what are you guys doing?
 Ross:Okay uhm... Hey you guys seen Joey anywhere?
 Ross:Well if you see him could you please tell him Im looking for him?
 Ross:Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)
 Ross:(knocks on door) Rach you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)
 Ross:(knocks) Rach?
 Ross:Is everything okay?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:You know where Joey is?
 Ross:Can I talk to you for a minute?
 Ross:And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
 Ross:And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
 Ross:Anyway one thing lead to another and... oh... before you know it we were kissing. I mean how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
 Ross:You know I gotta go find him. Hes gotta be here someplace.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You guys ready to go?
 Ross:Dude! Youre not taking your Bible?
 Ross:Learn about Jesus...
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Uh no... no. I couldnt find him. Im just gonna talk to him on the plane.
 Ross:Stop it!
 Ross:Youre filthy!
 Ross:Uh actually I think she went to the salon.
 Ross:Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
 Ross:Youve never said that in your life have you?
 Ross:I thought so.
 Ross:Oh I uh I mean I... dude I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
 Ross:No Ill do it. (he quickly grabs Joeys boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)
 Ross:Right Im gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. Hes always in a good mood after the flight attendant says duty free.
 Ross:Hey Rach...
 Ross:Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:So I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
 Ross:Okay last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that by the way... Well Charlie and I were talking and... well...
 Ross:Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?
 Ross:Yeah we kissed but... nothing else... nothing else happened okay.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Are you serious?
 Ross:I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean youre an incredible friend you know that?
 Ross:No I mean it. You are so loyal man and selfless and generous...
 Ross:You know what? I know Chandler longer so I always think of him as my best friend but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
 Ross:Hey if there is ever anything I can do for you...
 Ross:Thanks!
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Ah yeah. We had a really good talk.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Oh no its great. Its great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
 Ross:Well Im so excited about this.
 Ross:Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
 Ross:(gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)
 Ross:Ooh hey Emma daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
 Ross:(unpacking his bag) Okay shoot!
 Ross:(gasps) OH NO!
 Ross:Oh major shampoo explosion!
 Ross:Oh its all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)
 Ross:Im sorry Im sorry. You were saying?
 Ross:Oh not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. Its even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
 Ross:Duh you think? (enters the kitchen)
 Ross:So you two are..?
 Ross:And have you .. ed?
 Ross:But if I hadnt walked in here would you..?
 Ross:Im not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
 Ross:Hey hey hey... If you two are happy then Im happy for you. (Squeaky.) Im fine!
 Ross:Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) Im fine! Totally fine. I dont know why its coming out all loud and squeaky cause really (deep voice) Im fine. Im not saying I wasnt a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that Ive had time to absorb it; Lovin this.
 Ross:Its all working out! Me & Charlie and you two. You know what we should do?
 Ross:No. We should all have dinner. Yes well do it tomorrow night. Ill cook!!
 Ross:Weird? What? Whats weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didnt like Mexican food because Im making fajitas!! (Storms off.)
 Ross:I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! Youre gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) Im just kidding I know Rachel I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come please come in. Come in.
 Ross:Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) Shes a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
 Ross:Underwear a toothbrush and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
 Ross:What? Fine? Because I am! Arent you? Arent you? Arent you? You see? Who else is fine?
 Ross:You know what? That is a very good idea. Im gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
 Ross:The first batch of margaritas was not so great but the second batch is gooooood.
 Ross:Oh guys this is fun isnt it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin.
 Ross:Im fine! Hey Im great! Im just.. Im just proud of us. Theres no weirdness no tension.
 Ross:We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Lets take a trip. Okay where do you think we - we can go?
 Ross:My fajitas!!
 Ross:Fajitas! Be careful very hot plate very hot plate!!
 Ross:That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
 Ross:Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
 Ross:And to love. Ah love. L-O-V-E love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
 Ross:O is for oh wow! The V is for this very surprising turn of events which Im still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
 Ross:Totally.
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Wasnt it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Okay I guess its just flan for three! Hey hey that rhymed!
 Ross:Oh oh. Of course. God Im so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean you probably just want to be alone.
 Ross:Hey hey its fine. Its totally fine. Weve got plenty of margaritas. Its all good.
 Ross:I dont even know what thats for.
 Ross:Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
 Ross:So you took off my pants and shoes?
 Ross:What do you mean?
 Ross:Hey what are you talking about? Im fine!
 Ross:Except were not. I mean we havent been a couple in like six years. Oh my god is that right? Has it been that long?
 Ross:This is crazy. I mean six years? And because of me you guys arent gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really what is this thing with you and Rachel?
 Ross:Joey.
 Ross:And she feels the same way?
 Ross:Well then maybe its time we all moved on.
 Ross:No but I wanna be. Hey I will be. Besides Im with Charlie right? Oh my god Im still with Charlie arent I? I mean she didnt see the dance did she?
 Ross:Yeah Im sure.
 Ross:(looking at Monicas legs) WOW!
 Ross:Im sorry its just... how did you get so tan?
 Ross:Eh you got a spray-on tan?
 Ross:(laughing) Why why you do like with the-the toe separators?
 Ross:Still I cant believe thats sprayed on... I mean it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
 Ross:So do you get colours or just French tips?
 Ross:Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)
 Ross:Well... I like how you look what are you?
 Ross:Two I think a two.
 Ross:Spray count pat then turn spray count and pat.
 Ross:Well I have a PhD so... (assistant walk out not impressed by this statement)
 Ross:One Mississipi two Mississipi Three Mis...(the sprayer starts again spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! Im not-Ive not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)
 Ross:You sprayed my front twice!
 Ross:No I barely even got to three Mississippi.
 Ross:Mississippilesly? (pause) Well how bad is it?
 Ross:So how dark is it gonna get?
 Ross:Im a four?
 Ross:(sarcastically) Really!
 Ross:(annoyed) Ok!
 Ross:Wait wait a minute theres no light on the back wall! How do I know when its gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins on his face) Ah oh ah! (he turns but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!
 Ross:(hysterically) Im an eight!
 Ross:I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
 Ross:Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. Theres a distinct line across his body where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
 Ross:(looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?
 Ross:(Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters sees him and starts laughing)
 Ross:(Still yelling) I Know!
 Ross:Im gonna stop you right there Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time huh? Now I want 4 twos... and I want them all on my back.
 Ross:Wait a minute theres two sets of nozzles which one is it?
 Ross:Which... which... which... Which one is it?
 Ross:OH! SON OF A BITCH!
 Ross:Go away! I dont want to see anybody.
 Ross:Really? Did you count Mississipily?
 Ross:Dude youre not tanned.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Cmon you guys this is really important to us.
 Ross:Yeah we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
 Ross:(he enters) Hey guys!
 Ross:Hey I brought the camera for Emmas video.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Thats the hope! So is Emma awake yet?
 Ross:Ah and where is Joey?
 Ross:(taping Joey with the cam) Hey there is uncle Joey!
 Ross:Hey say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
 Ross:Joey NO!
 Ross:When they see this youll be 52!
 Ross:(points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!
 Ross:(pointing the camcorder at himself) Theres something you didnt know about your dad!
 Ross:Oh great!
 Ross:Thank you so much for that gift!
 Ross:Amazing... amazing.
 Ross:Sure.
 Ross:Uh Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
 Ross:I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
 Ross:Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!
 Ross:Hey Mon that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
 Ross:Well you know what? While were waiting you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!
 Ross:You guys just please.. a little bit longer. I promise Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica remember.. the frosting? huh?
 Ross:(Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok Ill be right there. (Puts the phone down)
 Ross:No Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
 Ross:No wait ! You guys no no you cant leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cakes messed up. How do you think shes gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
 Ross:Joey! Youre in charge ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
 Ross:RACHEL!
 Ross:(sarcastically) I cant believe they gave you a ticket. Youre such a good driver.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Hey maybe I can fix that you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)
 Ross:Rach shes not going to remember this.
 Ross:(looks back at the cake) Hey!
 Ross:Its not bad.
 Ross:Well I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
 Ross:Some can sing some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
 Ross:Joey we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
 Ross:Oh my God! Our daughters a genius! Rach this means...
 Ross:Damnit! Ill put a candle on the cake.
 Ross:Okay here we go! Emmas first birthday cake... Well hey... well blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
 Ross:Whats wrong? Are you okay?
 Ross:Okay you ready?
 Ross:A-a-and... record.
 Ross:Hey...
 Ross:(surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... Id love to but I really have to grade these papers.
 Ross:(Writing on the papers) B B B B B!
 Ross:Well it had some good ideas take off your shirt.
 Ross:Damnit!
 Ross:(he opens the door) Hi Amy!
 Ross:Still sharp as a tack!
 Ross:(pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
 Ross:(gives up) Yes yes you did.
 Ross:Hi Rachel! Heres your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
 Ross:Ehm... Her name is Emma.
 Ross:What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
 Ross:(to Joey) Oh my God!
 Ross:What... what you working on?
 Ross:Why dont you use your Thesaurus?
 Ross:Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
 Ross:Seriously?
 Ross:Well do you wanna marry him?
 Ross:Absolutely! Youll love the feeling! Theres nothing like it!
 Ross:No I cant. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throats been hurting?
 Ross:I dont think thats what this is.
 Ross:(He interrupts her immediately and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well can I talk to you for a sec.?
 Ross:Um I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
 Ross:Well for one thing she keeps calling her Ella!
 Ross:Fine well call the next one Ella.
 Ross:(a little confused) Okay um... I dont want her watching our baby.
 Ross:I... I dont know..
 Ross:Hey guys. 
 Ross:Hey Emma. Oh why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off but Rachel tries to stop him).
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:Come here (Removes Emmas hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
 Ross:(sees how strangely Monica Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
 Ross:(Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.
 Ross:Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldnt have left Emma with her!
 Ross:Thats not a thing!
 Ross:(very angry) Amy I ju... I just... I just wanna...
 Ross:(pointing at Amy shouting) No more falafel for you!
 Ross:Pheebs whats wrong?
 Ross:So did he get on one knee did he have a speech prepared or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah big surprise I like proposals!
 Ross:(to Charlie) Hey!
 Ross:Guess whos a finalist for a huge research grant! Ill give you a hint hes looking right at you.
 Ross:Oh Im so excited I mean apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that Im keeping score or anything... five!
 Ross:Well ok its for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it Ill finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the Paleontology Review! Yeah! Thatll be the first time my name is in there without people raising serious questions about my work!
 Ross:Yeah. Why?
 Ross:Your ex-boyfriend?
 Ross:So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow your new boyfriend is screwed!
 Ross:Well if you think it would help.
 Ross:Ok now is there anything I can do to... you know butter him up? Anything he really likes?
 Ross:Well see how dinner goes.
 Ross:I cant believe Im about to meet Benjamin Hobart. Ive always thought of him as one of the people Id invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think theres any chance hell bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
 Ross:Well I... I am having a good hair day.
 Ross:Im ok.
 Ross:Its an honor to meet you. I cant tell you how long Ive been an admirer of your work I mean that Nobel prize (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean I have to tell you that youre one of the reasons I got into the field.
 Ross:No but its you know its just a funny image you know the two of you in this restaurant with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz mmm.
 Ross:Ok well I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
 Ross:See there are still several areas that havent been fully excavated.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Did you just say break up with Charlie?
 Ross:Kind of inappropriate dont you think?
 Ross:Are you serious?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:(Rolls his eyes) I guess!
 Ross:(shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say Whats wrong? Answer the question)
 Ross:(annoyed) May 12th?
 Ross:(even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
 Ross:Wha...? Wait wait wait just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
 Ross:(annoyed) um... Ive never heard of a Boscodictiasaur.
 Ross:(stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly) B - O - S ...
 Ross:Oh come on!!
 Ross:Oh hi! Hello! Uh have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmothers nickname perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margarets pants size?
 Ross:(Sarcastic) No! Stop!
 Ross:(Skeptical) Really?
 Ross:I have to break up with Charlie?
 Ross:Youre crazy.
 Ross:Crazy!
 Ross:(Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
 Ross:Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
 Ross:No I didnt and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
 Ross:Yeah. He wouldnt give me the grant because I wouldnt give you up.
 Ross:Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review who was the voice of Underdog?
 Ross:If you dont believe me lets go talk to him okay? Im telling you he didnt ask me one paleontological question.
 Ross:Oh Im sorry no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
 Ross:Damnit!
 Ross:I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! Thats the voice of Underdog!
 Ross:No no no. Dont do that! I want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth.
 Ross:Too little too late Benji!
 Ross:(indignant) No!

 Ross:or...
 Ross:Sweetie this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
 Ross:Okay thats it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!

 Ross:Yeah and Im responsible for just like half of that.

 Ross:No no no. The next time its gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!
 Ross:(he enters) Hi!
 Ross:Oh good!
 Ross:Oh thats OK. Im sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
 Ross:There was one! Shes it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
 Ross:Well I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
 Ross:Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
 Ross:Be-caaauuuse...
 Ross:Seriously?
 Ross:(sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder whos gonna play you in the movie!
 Ross:Look Im sorry to hear about your tragedy ok? But the swings are perfectly safe and besides Emma loves them. You know what you should come with us and youll see!
 Ross:Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look please just come on you know when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face I swear you won’t regret it.
 Ross:Good you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children do you?
 Ross:Oh yeah that’s the same I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:Rach she’s got like three hairs!
 Ross:I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
 Ross:Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)
 Ross:See I told you!
 Ross:Oh absolutely!
 Ross:Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared of swings I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!
 Ross:SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) (To the 
 Ross:No! No no no no okay it wasnt the swings fault. It was my fault and kind 
 Ross:No wait okay okay I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing okay? And 
 Ross:Look I just think youre an adult okay? And you should get over your silly 
 Ross:Good.
 Ross:(He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
 Ross:I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again 
 Ross:(nervously) Ok...
 Ross:(Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok get on the swing!
 Ross:See?
 Ross:There you go! Good for you! And you know what Im actually getting used to this little guy. I dont really even feel him in here anymore.
 Ross:Well... (realizes screaming like a little girl trying to get rid of the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
 Ross:Are you kidding?
 Ross:(skeptical) That doesnt sound like you... Thats Monica talking!
 Ross:Shes putting words in your mouth!
 Ross:Hey! Hey guess what Joey has!

 Ross:Were still going at the game right?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Oh! What a game huh?
 Ross:I cant believe Chandler is missing this!
 Ross:Yeah Id probably enjoy it more if you didnt keep batting my hand away.
 Ross:I know I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldnt read my banner!
 Ross:Oh but its a kind game! So were a little late you know the girls will be there lets stay just for one more goal.

 Ross:Yeah yeah whats with the trophy!
 Ross:You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
 Ross:Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachels hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling New York Division.
 Ross:You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
 Ross:I cant believe this shes our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
 Ross:So this is an annual thing?
 Ross:Yeah. What are we gonna do?
 Ross:Ooh well say that we were mugged! You cant get mad at someone whos been mugged!
 Ross:(to Joey) HEY!
 Ross:I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
 Ross:(sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
 Ross:(Reading the note) We know youre out there. (Rachel gasps)
 Ross:Well lets just go in there and face them.
 Ross:What is that?
 Ross:Wha...? Oh sure now they lock it but when theyre having sex on the couch its like Come on in my butt is surprisingly hairy.
 Ross:Come on you guys were sorry alri...? Our subway broke down.
 Ross:(to Joey who is wearing a blue 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
 Ross:How are we gonna decide who gets this?
 Ross:Thats worse than no food.
 Ross:I dont know...
 Ross:(Staring back and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah he can do it!
 Ross:I feel terrible.
 Ross:Really girls not cool.
 Ross:Its a day to be thankful.
 Ross:Yeah! Lets go out.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:I gave them to Joey.
 Ross:(looking at Joeys butt) Im finding it really hard not to mess with him.
 Ross:Nice!
 Ross:Im just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Come on shes gonna love you guys!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Hey you guys I need some fashion advice.
 Ross:(he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?
 Ross:Cmon! This looks good!
 Ross:Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
 Ross:Really? That would be great. I mean I have to do something she kinda teased me about how I dress.
 Ross:Youre wearing the same shirt.
 Ross:You know we should just go I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
 Ross:Rach come on I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).
 Ross:(feeling the fabric) Wow this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?
 Ross:Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys?
 Ross:All right that’s it I’m getting out of here.
 Ross:Uh actually these might look pretty good on me.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:So you’re saying uh if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
 Ross:(to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
 Ross:(not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? Im glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
 Ross:Oh I see somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
 Ross:Youre just jealous because you couldnt pull this off. Yeah now if youll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!
 Ross:Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and Im so glad were finally doing this.
 Ross:Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)
 Ross:Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
 Ross:Because its soft... Hey so how was your date?
 Ross:Well looks like its just the two of us tonight huh old buddy?
 Ross:(mortified) Hi.
 Ross:I just feel like someone reached down my throat grabbed my small intestine pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:No no dont! Stop cleansing my aura! No just leave my aura alone okay?
 Ross:Ill be fine alright? Really everyone. I hope shell be very happy.
 Ross:No I dont to hell with her she left me!
 Ross:No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didnt know how should I know?
 Ross:I told mom and dad last night they seemed to take it pretty well.
 Ross:Sorry.
 Ross:I dont want to be single okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:(in a deep voice) Ill have whatever Christine is having.
 Ross:You can see where hed have trouble.
 Ross:Paul the Wine Guy Paul?
 Ross:He finally asked you out?
 Ross:(choked voice) Thatd be good...
 Ross:(normal voice) No go on! Its Paul the Wine Guy!
 Ross:A wandering?
 Ross:So Rachel whatre you uh... whatre you up to tonight?
 Ross:Right youre not even getting your honeymoon God.. No no although Aruba this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway if you dont feel like being alone tonight Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
 Ross:Okay sure.
 Ross:(squatting and reading the instructions) Im supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
 Ross:(clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carols favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can I should have known.
 Ross:You guys.
 Ross:Im divorced!  Im only 26 and Im divorced!
 Ross:That only took me an hour.
 Ross:You know what the scariest part is? What if theres only one woman for everybody yknow? I mean what if you get one woman- and thats it? Unfortunately in my case there was only one woman- for her...
 Ross:I honestly dont know if Im hungry or horny.
 Ross:(scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long its been since Ive grabbed a spoon? Do the words Billy dont be a hero mean anything to you?
 Ross:Yknow heres the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)
 Ross:I assume were looking for an answer more sophisticated than to get you into bed.
 Ross:You got a job?
 Ross:The word youre looking for is Anyway...
 Ross:Come on you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
 Ross:Cmon cut. Cut cut cut...
 Ross:No. No I gotta go home sometime.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh no-
 Ross:No no no go-
 Ross:Split it?
 Ross:Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didnt know this but back in high school I had a um major crush on you.
 Ross:You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monicas geeky older brother.
 Ross:Oh. Listen do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
 Ross:Okay... okay maybe I will...
 Ross:Goodnight.
 Ross:I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
 Ross:Theres an image.
 Ross:Food.
 Ross:Oh my God. Its like Sophies Choice.
 Ross:I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
 Ross:I know and with the baby coming?
 Ross:I don’t know. Phoebe if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
 Ross:No one I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
 Ross:(yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy it was hypothetical!
 Ross:Believe me if I did see with someone there’s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)
 Ross:We think Chandler might be having an affair.
 Ross:Whats going on?
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:(sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50s?
 Ross:You know what if you wanna look for a house thats okay.
 Ross:(to Joey) Its ok because they have to get it out of their system okay (back to Mon and Chan) but youre going to realize this is the only place you wanna be.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:You put an offer on a house?
 Ross:Yeah I mean if you moved there you have to leave here. I mean how can you leave this place?
 Ross:You can see where hed have trouble.
 Ross:That money is mine Green!
 Ross:What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
 Ross:Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
 Ross:Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
 Ross:Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
 Ross:Two seconds...
 Ross:11 unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.)
 Ross:(to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
 Ross:No 19.
 Ross:Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
 Ross:Correct his profession was?
 Ross:Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
 Ross:10 seconds you need this or you lose the game.
 Ross:Don’t blame the questions!
 Ross:Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
 Ross:What the hell are doing?!!
 Ross:(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
 Ross:(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)
 Ross:And hey heres to a lousy Christmas.
 Ross:You know sometimes when Im alone in my apartment I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs the Yangs? They dont make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)
 Ross:Yeah. Im sorry too. Im even more sorry that that phone call didnt come before I told you about looking through the window.
 Ross:Love you guys. (he kisses Monica he Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
 Ross:I love this. (he got a sweater)
 Ross:Seriously you guys whats going on? What are these for?
 Ross:Really? Which one?
 Ross:Things you find in the ocean (to Joey) Youre gonna be on Pyramid!!
 Ross:Except for Match game...
 Ross:Oh and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I cant believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
 Ross:(very excited) Yeah-uh!
 Ross:(singing) ...and Im a little bit rock n roll!
 Ross:So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God look theres Geoffrey Cleric.
 Ross:He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
 Ross:Hey theres Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
 Ross:Dude. Youre married to my sister.
 Ross:Hey I hear shes single again dyou think I should ask her out?

 Ross:Boss!
 Ross:Shes gone.
 Ross:Dude I was gonna ask her out.
 Ross:Well I thought it first Holmes.
 Ross:Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean we can get laid anytime we want.
 Ross:Me too. Im good at it.
 Ross:You got it.
 Ross:Those are the pacts!
 Ross:Oh oh... maybe not you!
 Ross:Thank you. (they shake hands) All right here I go. Hey remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
 Ross:I know and I cant stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)
 Ross:So Saturday night!
 Ross:Great!
 Ross:Oh well uh this is gonna sound kinda silly but do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
 Ross:Its been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
 Ross:Thats ok. Uh anyway well he and I both really liked you a lot uhm but we didnt want anything to jeopardize our friendship so we kinda made a pact that neither of us could ask you out!
 Ross:Yeah why?
 Ross:You did?
 Ross:(angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
 Ross:(To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that after you promised me?
 Ross:You broke the pact!
 Ross:That doesnt matter! Were talking about the foundation of our friendship.
 Ross:I didnt.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:NO!
 Ross:I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
 Ross:I dont know what... youre talking about.
 Ross:Listen Adrienne you cant tell Chandler about this.
 Ross:Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
 Ross:I didnt know you knew about that.
 Ross:(looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... Im sorry.
 Ross:So eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess were even.
 Ross:We are even right?
 Ross:(thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?
 Ross:Hey wheres Rachel?
 Ross:Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
 Ross:Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
 Ross:Well it matters to me.
 Ross:Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
 Ross:Okay after you told me she was passed out in our room I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed all buried in peoples coats. Well I went to kiss her on the forehead you know. But it was so dark I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second but... it was amazing. And now now I find out that you kissed her first.
 Ross:Mine.
 Ross:No she was definitely on my bed.
 Ross:Well then who was on my bed?
 Ross:(realizing) NO! No no!
 Ross:You were under the pile of coats?
 Ross:OH MY GOD!
 Ross:You were my first kiss with Rachel?
 Ross:Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)
 Ross:Oh (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
 Ross:That is why!
 Ross:Yeah I thought wed be groomsmen but wouldnt they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
 Ross:I wanna say its not looking good.
 Ross:What? (Ross and Chandler dont know what to say so theres an embarrassing long pause)
 Ross:Oh man!
 Ross:FOOTBALL!
 Ross:I cant believe were gonna be the only people that arent in this wedding.
 Ross:And its a wedding! Itd be weird if Im not in it...
 Ross:Who cares AND?
 Ross:Ill do it!
 Ross:No Mike no no. You wanna pick me I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?
 Ross:(to Chandler) Well if Phoebes choosing then say hello to Mikes next groomsman.
 Ross:Please youre going down!
 Ross:Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
 Ross:So what did you decide?
 Ross:Ill do it! (Monica approaches)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Wheres Rach?
 Ross:I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation ok? Im not gonna watch Chandler up there while Im sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachels room knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! Youre breathtaking!
 Ross:You havent by any chance chosen a groomsman yet have you?
 Ross:Im not! Im making it easier! Pick me!
 Ross:Listen listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now I promise I wont say a word but if you pick Chandler hes gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
 Ross:(waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES YES!
 Ross:(smiling to himself) Good. Im just getting some coffee. So Im alert for the wedding.
 Ross:(barely containing himself at this point) Well you have fun tonight.
 Ross:Oh I will.
 Ross:Wait a minute I know why Im being such an ass why are you?
 Ross:Im not supposed to tell you!
 Ross:Rachel only one of us can do it you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)
 Ross:What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
 Ross:(to Rachel) Haha! Looks like youre not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs.
 Ross:(To Phoebe and Mike) I cant believe you guys arent going to be able to get married today.
 Ross:No but Chandler hello... Arent you scared of dogs?
 Ross:(takes Chappy from Mike) Well I guess Im in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!
 Ross:Uhm ministers dont ride the subway for free.
 Ross:Ill...
 Ross:Its the dog.
 Ross:Uh Joey...
 Ross:Chappys heart rate has slowed way down.
 Ross:Come on Chappy do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
 Ross:Joey you shouldnt lie on your résumé.
 Ross:(whispering) It was ok...
 Ross:(he enters) Hey.
 Ross:You guys know where Rachel is?
 Ross:So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What? Shes gonna eat all those cookies?
 Ross:So why is Erica coming to visit?
 Ross:(looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
 Ross:No no no Im sure you have a great excuse wh-was it a hair appointment a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barneys?
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:Is-is he ok?
 Ross:Ok ok. Im gonna come out to Long Island with you I mean you cant be alone right now.
 Ross:Still-still let me come... for me.
 Ross:I bet someone could use one of Monicas freshly baked cookies.
 Ross:Oh!
 Ross:And Im Doctor Ross Geller.
 Ross:Rach I think Im gonna wait out here because my throat is feeling a little scratchy I dont want to infect him.
 Ross:Im not scared of him Im really sick!
 Ross:Im feeling better.

 Ross:Right is it painful?
 Ross:Nope just the one. RACH!
 Ross:Hey!

 Ross:Oh yeah. Emmas doing great.
 Ross:Wow.
 Ross:Just cant believe Im in Rachel Greens room.
 Ross:Yeah sure right! Like Ive ever been in Rachel Greens room.
 Ross:Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?

 Ross:But we do! (pause) Its gonna be ok Rach!
 Ross:What? No no! Hey hey hey look...
 Ross:They gave him a lot of medication ok? He wouldnt even know if you were there. Look well go see him first thing in the morning ok?
 Ross:No God! Hey Rach youve been an amazing daughter ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
 Ross:(he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.
 Ross:Sure!
 Ross:Oh of course...
 Ross:Me too. Come here. (They hug)
 Ross:Ok well uh I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or...(Theres one of those moments. Theyre staring at each other no word uttered and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No Rach! Im sorry I just dont think this this this is a good idea.
 Ross:No look uh. You are upset about your father and youre feeling vulnerable and I just dont feel it would be right Id feel like Id be you know taking advantage of you.
 Ross:Look Im sure it would be great but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly so Im gonna go!
 Ross:Ill see you in the morning (he leaves).

 Ross:Hey Rach can you grab me a cup of coffee?
 Ross:Youve been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
 Ross:You sure youre alright?
 Ross:(knowing shes not alright) O-kay. Well Im gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)
 Ross:(knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
 Ross:(half amused) Wait wait (looks around a little) Youre mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
 Ross:(acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...
 Ross:I cant believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
 Ross:Hey I was looking out for you.
 Ross:I gotta say I have not had sex a lot of times before this is the worst ever.
 Ross:Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future lets just say you and me never having sex again.
 Ross:Thats right sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green are you feeling better? (Rachels dad glares at him with a deadly look)
 Ross:Emmas down for the night.
 Ross:So uh... I guess I wanna take off.

 Ross:No seriously. I have job security for life. You know I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
 Ross:Rach Im so sorry.
 Ross:Great. I feel like an idiot.
 Ross:Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.
 Ross:(stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic) Im sorry its almost as if this wasnt built for a quick getaway!
 Ross:Uh you know you cant always get a seat on the subway so... (laughs stupidly)
 Ross:Yeah! yeah I got tenure! (Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
 Ross:See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. Ive met him before?
 Ross:(realizing) That is Mark?
 Ross:I hate that guy.
 Ross:No no NO you cannot go to dinner with him.
 Ross:Oh yeah Im sure hes gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
 Ross:Im serious. I just dont trust that guy okay?
 Ross:Hey is Rachel here?
 Ross:Shes still at dinner?
 Ross:That guy Mark. From Bloomingdales... She thinks hes just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
 Ross:We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
 Ross:Hey so uhm... How was dinner?
 Ross:(speaking without pause agitated) Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
 Ross:Should we send something?
 Ross:Congratulations!
 Ross:Can we can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along huh? You didnt believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
 Ross:(gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
 Ross:So if you take this job youll be moving to Paris?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:All right well work it out.
 Ross:Yeah yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
 Ross:Well Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
 Ross:Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back she would take it?
 Ross:I dont know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
 Ross:I didnt say we were brothers.
 Ross:Yeah Im a friend of Rachel Greens. Uhm actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
 Ross:Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
 Ross:Uhm well... Im here to see if youll give Rachel her job back.
 Ross:Oh no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then well see if she wants to come back.
 Ross:Look she loved her job here. And lets face it youre not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isnt that true?
 Ross:(surprised) Huh I took a shot there.
 Ross:I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.) Is this your son?
 Ross:Oh nothing it’s just it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
 Ross:How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left just the two of us and he can touch anything he wants. (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
 Ross:You let Rachel come back and it’s done.
 Ross:Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear your kid is going to have the time of his life.
 Ross:He’ll be fine.
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:Nooo!
 Ross:So you’re not going to Paris.
 Ross:Wh… wh…what?
 Ross:Yeeeah! (They high-five)
 Ross:(enters) Its me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed) Look I um I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
 Ross:Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks hopeful)
 Ross:Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
 Ross:Huh? So? We have a deal?
 Ross:Yes! yes!
 Ross:Oh (grins) Believe me the ladies they love it!
 Ross:Good cause the ladies not so much. (shakes his head give him a thumbs up and leaves)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:They did?
 Ross:So what are you gonna do?
 Ross:Thats great! So youre staying in New York!
 Ross:Youre excited right?
 Ross:Right!
 Ross:Uhm I hadnt no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm I mean you said you were scared.
 Ross:(after a long pause) You should go.
 Ross:Its what you want. You should go.
 Ross:I really do.
 Ross:(picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) Im sure hell understand.
 Ross:Yeah...
 Ross:Yeah yeah oh! (They hug)
 Ross:Then Im happy too. (Theyre still hugging - fade out)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey Erica welcome back to town! (pause) Wow look how big youve gotten.
 Ross:Right no I understand.
 Ross:No no I knew (he stares at her breasts).
 Ross:She brought them up! (pause) I didnt realize you were coming back so soon!
 Ross:Hotel? Why isnt she staying with you guys?
 Ross:Erica those things arent free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
 Ross:Oh man I cant believe you guys are leaving this place.
 Ross:No no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
 Ross:Hey is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
 Ross:Mhm (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
 Ross:What are you guys doing?
 Ross:You got it! (Monica leaves Ross closes the door). All right shes right we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Lets put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
 Ross:Chandler you dont have a sister so you cant understand how much this bums me out.
 Ross:Bumming hard guys bumming hard.
 Ross:Yeah? Yeah where is it?
 Ross:Rock on!
 Ross:Hey wheres Rach?
 Ross:Great.
 Ross:Here she is!
 Ross:Oh man! I cant believe shes actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Hey what do you think theyre doing in there?
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?
 Ross:Are you kidding? Oh my God...
 Ross:Oh man Im not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
 Ross:(to Joey) Oh no she took down Monica... And Im the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she wont talk with me if it looks like were deep in converstation. Oh so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
 Ross:Well its okay. Chandler is talking to her.
 Ross:I dont think so.
 Ross:God! I cant believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long?
 Ross:Okay here we go...
 Ross:Yeah...
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:What? I dont get a goodbye?
 Ross:Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
 Ross:Well it needs to be plicit.
 Ross:No I dont think so.
 Ross:(annoyed) O-kay... I mean dont I deserve anything? I mean a few tears a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)
 Ross:THE HELL I DO!
 Ross:I dont get a goodbye?
 Ross:(talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye huh? Be best friends with you? Uh go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute wait a minute I did all those things.
 Ross:Oh no maybe its me Im just not giving you enough credit. Uh I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye good... (makes choking noises) ITS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all weve been through I cant believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)
 Ross:Thats what it seemed like.
 Ross:Fine then why didnt you say something?
 Ross:Rach!
 Ross:You keep you keep... You cant...
 Ross:Rach!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Oh. This was amazing.
 Ross:Yeah well this guy at work gave me Sex for Dummies as a joke.
 Ross:Whos laughing now?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh my God!
 Ross:Phoebe you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
 Ross:Is Rachel here?
 Ross:Uh we yknow we worked things out.
 Ross:Hey Im not one to kiss and tell but Im also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
 Ross:I know its pretty great.
 Ross:Oh I.. I dont know. We didnt really get to talk.
 Ross:I dont know. It was incredible. I mean it just felt so right. When I was holding her I mean I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah I do. I wanna be together.
 Ross:Shhh!
 Ross:Wow I hadnt thought of that. I hope not.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Hey. How did you sleep?
 Ross:Good.
 Ross:Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
 Ross:So...
 Ross:Morning.
 Ross:It really was.
 Ross:I know me too. It was... You know it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen and then it does and its everything you want it to be.
 Ross:And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
 Ross:Nothing! What do you say to that?
 Ross:No way!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:You really think so?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Alright you know what? Youre right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
 Ross:What? What?
 Ross:Oh my God!
 Ross:Im not getting you a muffin!
 Ross:Hey.

 Ross:Oh my God Phoebe slow down!
 Ross:Yes but I dont wanna die in your cab!

 Ross:Green. To the green.
 Ross:Not that big a deal? Its amazing. Ok you just reach in there theres one little maneuver and bam a bra right out the sleeve. All right as far as Im concerned there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?

 Ross:Its laundry. The thinking through is minimal.

 Ross:Was your basket on top?
 Ross:So?
 Ross:No suds? Excuse me hold on a second. (to woman) Thats my friends machine.
 Ross:Hey hey hey thats not the rule and you know it.

 Ross:Well thats because youre such a sweet gentle uh...Do you uh do you...Oh hey uh you must need detergent.
 Ross:Uberveiss. Its new its German its extra-tough.
 Ross:Rach do you uh are you gonna separate those?
 Ross:Rach have you never done this before?
 Ross:Uh well dont worry Ill use the gentle cycle. Ok um basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites a whole nother machine for colors and a third for your uh your uh delicates and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
 Ross:(visibly nervous) Uh that that that would be a judgment call.
 Ross:That does not sound stupid to me. You know its like the first time I had to make dinner for myself after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) Im sorry thats all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
 Ross:(not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh uh-oh the laundrys done. Its uh its a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundrys done uh-oh uh-oh.
 Ross:Nothing nothing. Lee-lo the laundrys done.

 Ross:Yeah uh except for the red sock which is still red. Im sorry please dont be upset it could happen to anyone.
 Ross:You got the clothes clean. Now thats the important part.
 Ross:You were incredible! Brand new woman ladies and gentlemen.

 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh. Hel-lo!
 Ross:He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
 Ross:Cmon! Cmon!
 Ross:No of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah yeah it is.
 Ross:Well yknow monogamy can be a uh tricky concept. I mean anthropologically speaking-
 Ross:Fine. Fine alright now youll never know.
 Ross:Alright. Theres a theory put forth by Richard Leakey-
 Ross:Oh yeah nobody knows. And were not supposed to ask.
 Ross:Oh cmon! When we were kids yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasnt raggedy!
 Ross:Alright you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives but you dont pay it right away.
 Ross:Because youre a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
 Ross:Monica? Youre Mom.
 Ross:Cmon seriously Joey whats the part?
 Ross:Youre right youre right it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
 Ross:Look at it this way you dumped her. Right? I mean this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful intelligent unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
 Ross:No? What happened big guy?
 Ross:It felt like a big guy moment.
 Ross:Yeah I mean... I think when its your shot yknow you-you know its your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
 Ross:She is a kook.
 Ross:And officiating at tonights blackout is Rabbi Tribbiani.
 Ross:Thats my sister.
 Ross:Pheebs what about you?
 Ross:Disneyland 1989 Its a Small World After All.
 Ross:The ride broke down. So Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
 Ross:Step back.
 Ross:Well it was the only thing to do there that didnt have a line.
 Ross:Come on.
 Ross:(sarcastically) And you didnt marry him because...?
 Ross:Probably. But you know Ill tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
 Ross:It is. Eventually it kind of... burns out. But hopefully what youre left with is trust and security and... well in the case of my ex-wife lesbianism. So you know for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing theres all that other good stuff.
 Ross:But um... I dont think thats going to be you.
 Ross:Uh-uh. See I see.... big passion in your future.
 Ross:Mmmm.
 Ross:I do.
 Ross:(innocently) What?
 Ross:(acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
 Ross:No no no. Im not in the zone.
 Ross:Im taking my time alright? Im laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean every day I get just a little bit closer to...

 Ross:Im going to do it.
 Ross:You come out there youre a dead man.
 Ross:Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
 Ross:OK I have a question. Well actually its not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
 Ross:OK. Here goes. For a while now Ive been wanting to um....
 Ross:Yes yes thats right...
 Ross:What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
 Ross:Why dont we just put poor little Tooty out in the hall?

 Ross:(knocks) Rach?
 Ross:Is everything okay?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:You know where Joey is?
 Ross:Can I talk to you for a minute?
 Ross:And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
 Ross:And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
 Ross:Anyway one thing lead to another and... oh... before you know it we were kissing. I mean how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
 Ross:You know I gotta go find him. Hes gotta be here someplace.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You guys ready to go?
 Ross:Dude! Youre not taking your Bible?
 Ross:Learn about Jesus...
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Uh no... no. I couldnt find him. Im just gonna talk to him on the plane.
 Ross:Stop it!
 Ross:Youre filthy!

 Ross:Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
 Ross:Youve never said that in your life have you?
 Ross:I thought so.
 Ross:Oh I uh I mean I... dude I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
 Ross:No Ill do it. (he quickly grabs Joeys boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)
 Ross:Right Im gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. Hes always in a good mood after the flight attendant says duty free.
 Ross:Hey Rach...
 Ross:Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:So I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
 Ross:Okay last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that by the way... Well Charlie and I were talking and... well...
 Ross:Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?
 Ross:Yeah we kissed but... nothing else... nothing else happened okay.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Are you serious?
 Ross:I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean youre an incredible friend you know that?
 Ross:No I mean it. You are so loyal man and selfless and generous...
 Ross:You know what? I know Chandler longer so I always think of him as my best friend but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
 Ross:Hey if there is ever anything I can do for you...
 Ross:Thanks!
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Ah yeah. We had a really good talk.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Oh no its great. Its great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
 Ross:Well Im so excited about this.

 Ross:(gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)
 Ross:Ooh hey Emma daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.

 Ross:Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) Shes a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
 Ross:Underwear a toothbrush and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
 Ross:What? Fine? Because I am! Arent you? Arent you? Arent you? You see? Who else is fine?
 Ross:You know what? That is a very good idea. Im gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.

 Ross:Oh guys this is fun isnt it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin.
 Ross:Im fine! Hey Im great! Im just.. Im just proud of us. Theres no weirdness no tension.

 Ross:That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
 Ross:Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
 Ross:And to love. Ah love. L-O-V-E love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
 Ross:O is for oh wow! The V is for this very surprising turn of events which Im still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
 Ross:Totally.
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Wasnt it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Okay I guess its just flan for three! Hey hey that rhymed!
 Ross:Oh oh. Of course. God Im so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean you probably just want to be alone.
 Ross:Hey hey its fine. Its totally fine. Weve got plenty of margaritas. Its all good.
 Ross:I dont even know what thats for.
 Ross:Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
 Ross:So you took off my pants and shoes?
 Ross:What do you mean?
 Ross:Hey what are you talking about? Im fine!
 Ross:Except were not. I mean we havent been a couple in like six years. Oh my god is that right? Has it been that long?
 Ross:This is crazy. I mean six years? And because of me you guys arent gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really what is this thing with you and Rachel?
 Ross:Joey.
 Ross:And she feels the same way?
 Ross:Well then maybe its time we all moved on.
 Ross:No but I wanna be. Hey I will be. Besides Im with Charlie right? Oh my god Im still with Charlie arent I? I mean she didnt see the dance did she?
 Ross:Yeah Im sure.

 Ross:Im sorry its just... how did you get so tan?
 Ross:Eh you got a spray-on tan?
 Ross:(laughing) Why why you do like with the-the toe separators?
 Ross:Still I cant believe thats sprayed on... I mean it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
 Ross:So do you get colours or just French tips?

 Ross:Im a four?
 Ross:(sarcastically) Really!
 Ross:(annoyed) Ok!
 Ross:Wait wait a minute theres no light on the back wall! How do I know when its gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins on his face) Ah oh ah! (he turns but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!
 Ross:(hysterically) Im an eight!
 Ross:I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
 Ross:Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. Theres a distinct line across his body where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
 Ross:(looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?
 Ross:(Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters sees him and starts laughing)
 Ross:(Still yelling) I Know!
 Ross:Im gonna stop you right there Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time huh? Now I want 4 twos... and I want them all on my back.
 Ross:Wait a minute theres two sets of nozzles which one is it?
 Ross:Which... which... which... Which one is it?

 Ross:Really? Did you count Mississipily?
 Ross:Dude youre not tanned.

 Ross:Oh great!
 Ross:Thank you so much for that gift!
 Ross:Amazing... amazing.
 Ross:Sure.
 Ross:Uh Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
 Ross:I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
 Ross:Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!
 Ross:Hey Mon that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
 Ross:Well you know what? While were waiting you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!
 Ross:You guys just please.. a little bit longer. I promise Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica remember.. the frosting? huh?
 Ross:(Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok Ill be right there. (Puts the phone down)
 Ross:No Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
 Ross:No wait ! You guys no no you cant leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cakes messed up. How do you think shes gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
 Ross:Joey! Youre in charge ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
 Ross:RACHEL!
 Ross:(sarcastically) I cant believe they gave you a ticket. Youre such a good driver.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Hey maybe I can fix that you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)
 Ross:Rach shes not going to remember this.
 Ross:(looks back at the cake) Hey!
 Ross:Its not bad.
 Ross:Well I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
 Ross:Some can sing some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
 Ross:Joey we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
 Ross:Oh my God! Our daughters a genius! Rach this means...
 Ross:Damnit! Ill put a candle on the cake.
 Ross:Okay here we go! Emmas first birthday cake... Well hey... well blow out the candle. Come on Emma.

 Ross:(gives up) Yes yes you did.
 Ross:Hi Rachel! Heres your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
 Ross:Ehm... Her name is Emma.
 Ross:What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
 Ross:(to Joey) Oh my God!
 Ross:What... what you working on?
 Ross:Why dont you use your Thesaurus?
 Ross:Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
 Ross:Seriously?
 Ross:Well do you wanna marry him?
 Ross:Absolutely! Youll love the feeling! Theres nothing like it!
 Ross:No I cant. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throats been hurting?
 Ross:I dont think thats what this is.
 Ross:(He interrupts her immediately and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well can I talk to you for a sec.?
 Ross:Um I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
 Ross:Well for one thing she keeps calling her Ella!
 Ross:Fine well call the next one Ella.
 Ross:(a little confused) Okay um... I dont want her watching our baby.
 Ross:I... I dont know..
 Ross:Hey guys. 
 Ross:Hey Emma. Oh why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off but Rachel tries to stop him).
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:Come here (Removes Emmas hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
 Ross:(sees how strangely Monica Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
 Ross:(Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.
 Ross:Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldnt have left Emma with her!
 Ross:Thats not a thing!
 Ross:(very angry) Amy I ju... I just... I just wanna...
 Ross:(pointing at Amy shouting) No more falafel for you!
 Ross:Pheebs whats wrong?
 Ross:So did he get on one knee did he have a speech prepared or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah big surprise I like proposals!
 Ross:(to Charlie) Hey!
 Ross:Guess whos a finalist for a huge research grant! Ill give you a hint hes looking right at you.
 Ross:Oh Im so excited I mean apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that Im keeping score or anything... five!
 Ross:Well ok its for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it Ill finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the Paleontology Review! Yeah! Thatll be the first time my name is in there without people raising serious questions about my work!
 Ross:Yeah. Why?
 Ross:Your ex-boyfriend?
 Ross:So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow your new boyfriend is screwed!
 Ross:Well if you think it would help.
 Ross:Ok now is there anything I can do to... you know butter him up? Anything he really likes?
 Ross:Well see how dinner goes.
 Ross:I cant believe Im about to meet Benjamin Hobart. Ive always thought of him as one of the people Id invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think theres any chance hell bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
 Ross:Well I... I am having a good hair day.
 Ross:Im ok.
 Ross:Its an honor to meet you. I cant tell you how long Ive been an admirer of your work I mean that Nobel prize (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean I have to tell you that youre one of the reasons I got into the field.
 Ross:No but its you know its just a funny image you know the two of you in this restaurant with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz mmm.
 Ross:Ok well I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
 Ross:See there are still several areas that havent been fully excavated.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Did you just say break up with Charlie?
 Ross:Kind of inappropriate dont you think?
 Ross:Are you serious?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:(Rolls his eyes) I guess!
 Ross:(shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say Whats wrong? Answer the question)
 Ross:(annoyed) May 12th?
 Ross:(even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
 Ross:Wha...? Wait wait wait just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
 Ross:(annoyed) um... Ive never heard of a Boscodictiasaur.
 Ross:(stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly) B - O - S ...
 Ross:Oh come on!!
 Ross:Oh hi! Hello! Uh have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmothers nickname perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margarets pants size?
 Ross:(Sarcastic) No! Stop!
 Ross:(Skeptical) Really?
 Ross:I have to break up with Charlie?
 Ross:Youre crazy.
 Ross:Crazy!
 Ross:(Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
 Ross:Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
 Ross:No I didnt and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
 Ross:Yeah. He wouldnt give me the grant because I wouldnt give you up.
 Ross:Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review who was the voice of Underdog?
 Ross:If you dont believe me lets go talk to him okay? Im telling you he didnt ask me one paleontological question.
 Ross:Oh Im sorry no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
 Ross:Damnit!
 Ross:I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! Thats the voice of Underdog!
 Ross:No no no. Dont do that! I want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth.
 Ross:Too little too late Benji!
 Ross:(indignant) No!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:or...
 Ross:Sweetie this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
 Ross:Okay thats it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
 Ross:Hey you guys!
 Ross:Hey what are you doing?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Theres no way around it Pheebs you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
 Ross:Yeah and Im responsible for just like half of that.
 Ross:Ive got to say you guys thats an incredible gesture!
 Ross:No no no. The next time its gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!
 Ross:(he enters) Hi!
 Ross:Oh good!
 Ross:Oh thats OK. Im sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
 Ross:There was one! Shes it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
 Ross:Well I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
 Ross:Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
 Ross:Be-caaauuuse...
 Ross:Seriously?
 Ross:(sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder whos gonna play you in the movie!
 Ross:Look Im sorry to hear about your tragedy ok? But the swings are perfectly safe and besides Emma loves them. You know what you should come with us and youll see!
 Ross:Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look please just come on you know when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face I swear you won’t regret it.
 Ross:Good you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children do you?
 Ross:Oh yeah that’s the same I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:Rach she’s got like three hairs!
 Ross:I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.

 Ross:No wait okay okay I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing okay? And

 Ross:I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again 
 Ross:(nervously) Ok...
 Ross:(Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok get on the swing!
 Ross:See?
 Ross:There you go! Good for you! And you know what Im actually getting used to this little guy. I dont really even feel him in here anymore.
 Ross:Well... (realizes screaming like a little girl trying to get rid of the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...

 Ross:Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachels hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling New York Division.
 Ross:You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
 Ross:I cant believe this shes our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
 Ross:So this is an annual thing?
 Ross:Yeah. What are we gonna do?
 Ross:Ooh well say that we were mugged! You cant get mad at someone whos been mugged!
 Ross:(to Joey) HEY!
 Ross:I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
 Ross:(sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
 Ross:(Reading the note) We know youre out there. (Rachel gasps)
 Ross:Well lets just go in there and face them.
 Ross:What is that?
 Ross:Wha...? Oh sure now they lock it but when theyre having sex on the couch its like Come on in my butt is surprisingly hairy.
 Ross:Come on you guys were sorry alri...? Our subway broke down.
 Ross:(to Joey who is wearing a blue 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
 Ross:How are we gonna decide who gets this?
 Ross:Thats worse than no food.
 Ross:I dont know...
 Ross:(Staring back and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah he can do it!
 Ross:I feel terrible.
 Ross:Really girls not cool.
 Ross:Its a day to be thankful.
 Ross:Yeah! Lets go out.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:I gave them to Joey.

 Ross:Nice!
 Ross:Im just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Come on shes gonna love you guys!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Hey you guys I need some fashion advice.

 Ross:Cmon! This looks good!
 Ross:Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
 Ross:Really? That would be great. I mean I have to do something she kinda teased me about how I dress.
 Ross:Youre wearing the same shirt.
 Ross:You know we should just go I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
 Ross:Rach come on I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).
 Ross:(feeling the fabric) Wow this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?
 Ross:Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys?
 Ross:All right that’s it I’m getting out of here.
 Ross:Uh actually these might look pretty good on me.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:So you’re saying uh if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
 Ross:(to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
 Ross:(not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? Im glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
 Ross:Oh I see somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
 Ross:Youre just jealous because you couldnt pull this off. Yeah now if youll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!
 Ross:Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and Im so glad were finally doing this.
 Ross:Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)
 Ross:Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
 Ross:Because its soft... Hey so how was your date?
 Ross:Well looks like its just the two of us tonight huh old buddy?
 Ross:(mortified) Hi.
 Ross:I just feel like someone reached down my throat grabbed my small intestine pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:No no dont! Stop cleansing my aura! No just leave my aura alone okay?
 Ross:Ill be fine alright? Really everyone. I hope shell be very happy.
 Ross:No I dont to hell with her she left me!
 Ross:No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didnt know how should I know?
 Ross:I told mom and dad last night they seemed to take it pretty well.
 Ross:Sorry.
 Ross:I dont want to be single okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:(in a deep voice) Ill have whatever Christine is having.
 Ross:You can see where hed have trouble.
 Ross:Paul the Wine Guy Paul?
 Ross:He finally asked you out?
 Ross:(choked voice) Thatd be good...
 Ross:(normal voice) No go on! Its Paul the Wine Guy!
 Ross:A wandering?
 Ross:So Rachel whatre you uh... whatre you up to tonight?
 Ross:Right youre not even getting your honeymoon God.. No no although Aruba this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway if you dont feel like being alone tonight Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
 Ross:Okay sure.
 Ross:(squatting and reading the instructions) Im supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
 Ross:(clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carols favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can I should have known.
 Ross:You guys.
 Ross:Im divorced!  Im only 26 and Im divorced!
 Ross:That only took me an hour.
 Ross:You know what the scariest part is? What if theres only one woman for everybody yknow? I mean what if you get one woman- and thats it? Unfortunately in my case there was only one woman- for her...
 Ross:I honestly dont know if Im hungry or horny.
 Ross:(scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long its been since Ive grabbed a spoon? Do the words Billy dont be a hero mean anything to you?
 Ross:Yknow heres the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)
 Ross:I assume were looking for an answer more sophisticated than to get you into bed.
 Ross:You got a job?
 Ross:The word youre looking for is Anyway...
 Ross:Come on you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
 Ross:Cmon cut. Cut cut cut...
 Ross:No. No I gotta go home sometime.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh no-
 Ross:No no no go-
 Ross:Split it?
 Ross:Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didnt know this but back in high school I had a um major crush on you.
 Ross:You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monicas geeky older brother.
 Ross:Oh. Listen do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
 Ross:Okay... okay maybe I will...
 Ross:Goodnight.
 Ross:I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
 Ross:Theres an image.
 Ross:Food.
 Ross:Oh my God. Its like Sophies Choice.
 Ross:I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
 Ross:I know and with the baby coming?
 Ross:I don’t know. Phoebe if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
 Ross:No one I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
 Ross:(yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy it was hypothetical!
 Ross:Believe me if I did see with someone there’s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)
 Ross:We think Chandler might be having an affair.
 Ross:Whats going on?
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:(sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50s?
 Ross:You know what if you wanna look for a house thats okay.
 Ross:(to Joey) Its ok because they have to get it out of their system okay (back to Mon and Chan) but youre going to realize this is the only place you wanna be.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:You put an offer on a house?
 Ross:Yeah I mean if you moved there you have to leave here. I mean how can you leave this place?
 Ross:You can see where hed have trouble.
 Ross:That money is mine Green!
 Ross:What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
 Ross:Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
 Ross:Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
 Ross:Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
 Ross:Two seconds...
 Ross:11 unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.)
 Ross:(to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
 Ross:No 19.
 Ross:Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
 Ross:Correct his profession was?
 Ross:Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
 Ross:10 seconds you need this or you lose the game.
 Ross:Don’t blame the questions!
 Ross:Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
 Ross:What the hell are doing?!!
 Ross:(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
 Ross:(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)
 Ross:And hey heres to a lousy Christmas.
 Ross:You know sometimes when Im alone in my apartment I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs the Yangs? They dont make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)
 Ross:Yeah. Im sorry too. Im even more sorry that that phone call didnt come before I told you about looking through the window.
 Ross:Love you guys. (he kisses Monica he Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
 Ross:I love this. (he got a sweater)
 Ross:Seriously you guys whats going on? What are these for?
 Ross:Really? Which one?
 Ross:Things you find in the ocean (to Joey) Youre gonna be on Pyramid!!
 Ross:Except for Match game...
 Ross:Oh and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I cant believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
 Ross:(very excited) Yeah-uh!
 Ross:(singing) ...and Im a little bit rock n roll!
 Ross:So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God look theres Geoffrey Cleric.
 Ross:He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
 Ross:Hey theres Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
 Ross:Dude. Youre married to my sister.
 Ross:Hey I hear shes single again dyou think I should ask her out?
 Ross:Yes please.
 Ross:Hey. Hey check out the flyers for the band. I made em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
 Ross:Thanks to a little something called Helvetica Bold 24 point!
 Ross:Hey Missy...
 Ross:Yeah yeah. You should come check us out. Were called Way! No Way!.
 Ross:Boss!
 Ross:Shes gone.
 Ross:Dude I was gonna ask her out.
 Ross:Well I thought it first Holmes.
 Ross:Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean we can get laid anytime we want.
 Ross:Me too. Im good at it.
 Ross:You got it.
 Ross:Those are the pacts!
 Ross:Oh oh... maybe not you!
 Ross:Thank you. (they shake hands) All right here I go. Hey remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
 Ross:I know and I cant stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)
 Ross:So Saturday night!
 Ross:Great!
 Ross:Oh well uh this is gonna sound kinda silly but do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
 Ross:Its been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
 Ross:Thats ok. Uh anyway well he and I both really liked you a lot uhm but we didnt want anything to jeopardize our friendship so we kinda made a pact that neither of us could ask you out!
 Ross:Yeah why?
 Ross:You did?
 Ross:(angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
 Ross:(To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that after you promised me?
 Ross:You broke the pact!
 Ross:That doesnt matter! Were talking about the foundation of our friendship.
 Ross:I didnt.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:NO!
 Ross:I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
 Ross:I dont know what... youre talking about.
 Ross:Listen Adrienne you cant tell Chandler about this.
 Ross:Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
 Ross:I didnt know you knew about that.
 Ross:(looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... Im sorry.
 Ross:So eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess were even.
 Ross:We are even right?
 Ross:(thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?
 Ross:Hey wheres Rachel?
 Ross:Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
 Ross:Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
 Ross:Well it matters to me.
 Ross:Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
 Ross:Okay after you told me she was passed out in our room I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed all buried in peoples coats. Well I went to kiss her on the forehead you know. But it was so dark I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second but... it was amazing. And now now I find out that you kissed her first.
 Ross:Mine.
 Ross:No she was definitely on my bed.
 Ross:Well then who was on my bed?
 Ross:(realizing) NO! No no!
 Ross:You were under the pile of coats?
 Ross:OH MY GOD!
 Ross:You were my first kiss with Rachel?
 Ross:Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)
 Ross:Oh (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
 Ross:That is why!
 Ross:Yeah I thought wed be groomsmen but wouldnt they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
 Ross:I wanna say its not looking good.
 Ross:What? (Ross and Chandler dont know what to say so theres an embarrassing long pause)
 Ross:Oh man!
 Ross:FOOTBALL!
 Ross:I cant believe were gonna be the only people that arent in this wedding.
 Ross:And its a wedding! Itd be weird if Im not in it...
 Ross:Who cares AND?
 Ross:Ill do it!
 Ross:No Mike no no. You wanna pick me I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?
 Ross:(to Chandler) Well if Phoebes choosing then say hello to Mikes next groomsman.
 Ross:Please youre going down!
 Ross:Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
 Ross:So what did you decide?
 Ross:Ill do it! (Monica approaches)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Wheres Rach?
 Ross:I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation ok? Im not gonna watch Chandler up there while Im sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachels room knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! Youre breathtaking!
 Ross:You havent by any chance chosen a groomsman yet have you?
 Ross:Im not! Im making it easier! Pick me!
 Ross:Listen listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now I promise I wont say a word but if you pick Chandler hes gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
 Ross:(waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES YES!
 Ross:(smiling to himself) Good. Im just getting some coffee. So Im alert for the wedding.
 Ross:(barely containing himself at this point) Well you have fun tonight.
 Ross:Oh I will.
 Ross:Wait a minute I know why Im being such an ass why are you?
 Ross:Im not supposed to tell you!
 Ross:Rachel only one of us can do it you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)
 Ross:What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
 Ross:(to Rachel) Haha! Looks like youre not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs.
 Ross:(To Phoebe and Mike) I cant believe you guys arent going to be able to get married today.
 Ross:No but Chandler hello... Arent you scared of dogs?
 Ross:(takes Chappy from Mike) Well I guess Im in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!
 Ross:Uhm ministers dont ride the subway for free.
 Ross:Ill...
 Ross:Its the dog.
 Ross:Uh Joey...
 Ross:Chappys heart rate has slowed way down.
 Ross:Come on Chappy do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
 Ross:Joey you shouldnt lie on your résumé.
 Ross:(whispering) It was ok...
 Ross:(he enters) Hey.
 Ross:You guys know where Rachel is?
 Ross:So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What? Shes gonna eat all those cookies?
 Ross:So why is Erica coming to visit?
 Ross:(looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
 Ross:No no no Im sure you have a great excuse wh-was it a hair appointment a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barneys?
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:Is-is he ok?
 Ross:Ok ok. Im gonna come out to Long Island with you I mean you cant be alone right now.
 Ross:Still-still let me come... for me.
 Ross:I bet someone could use one of Monicas freshly baked cookies.
 Ross:Oh!
 Ross:And Im Doctor Ross Geller.
 Ross:Rach I think Im gonna wait out here because my throat is feeling a little scratchy I dont want to infect him.
 Ross:Im not scared of him Im really sick!
 Ross:Im feeling better.
 Ross:Hes unconscious I think well be just fine!
 Ross:Did the TV wake you?
 Ross:Ouchy.
 Ross:Well I came with Rachel who should be back any second! (pause) So whats new?
 Ross:Right is it painful?
 Ross:Nope just the one. RACH!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dads fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
 Ross:Oh yeah. Emmas doing great.
 Ross:Wow.
 Ross:Just cant believe Im in Rachel Greens room.
 Ross:Yeah sure right! Like Ive ever been in Rachel Greens room.
 Ross:Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?
 Ross:You had a rough day uh?
 Ross:But we do! (pause) Its gonna be ok Rach!
 Ross:What? No no! Hey hey hey look...
 Ross:They gave him a lot of medication ok? He wouldnt even know if you were there. Look well go see him first thing in the morning ok?
 Ross:No God! Hey Rach youve been an amazing daughter ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
 Ross:(he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.
 Ross:Sure!
 Ross:Oh of course...
 Ross:Me too. Come here. (They hug)
 Ross:Ok well uh I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or...(Theres one of those moments. Theyre staring at each other no word uttered and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No Rach! Im sorry I just dont think this this this is a good idea.
 Ross:No look uh. You are upset about your father and youre feeling vulnerable and I just dont feel it would be right Id feel like Id be you know taking advantage of you.
 Ross:Look Im sure it would be great but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly so Im gonna go!
 Ross:Ill see you in the morning (he leaves).
 Ross:(outside her room talking by himself) Havent had sex in four months I should get a medal for that!
 Ross:Hey Rach can you grab me a cup of coffee?
 Ross:Youve been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
 Ross:You sure youre alright?
 Ross:(knowing shes not alright) O-kay. Well Im gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)
 Ross:(knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
 Ross:(half amused) Wait wait (looks around a little) Youre mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
 Ross:(acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...
 Ross:I cant believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
 Ross:Hey I was looking out for you.
 Ross:I gotta say I have not had sex a lot of times before this is the worst ever.
 Ross:Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future lets just say you and me never having sex again.
 Ross:Thats right sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green are you feeling better? (Rachels dad glares at him with a deadly look)
 Ross:Emmas down for the night.
 Ross:So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
 Ross:Oh no problem.
 Ross:Thank you. Im glad you agree.
 Ross:Yeah... Yeah thats true.
 Ross:Oh ye-ah!

 Ross:I got tenure. I didnt win the lottery... Hey Rach so uh... how did your thing go?
 Ross:Oh you know what? Youre gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
 Ross:And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
 Ross:But also knowing it means a lot.
 Ross:...that center around work.
 Ross:You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
 Ross:No seriously. I have job security for life. You know I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
 Ross:Rach Im so sorry.
 Ross:Great. I feel like an idiot.
 Ross:Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.
 Ross:(stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic) Im sorry its almost as if this wasnt built for a quick getaway!
 Ross:Uh you know you cant always get a seat on the subway so... (laughs stupidly)
 Ross:Yeah! yeah I got tenure! (Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
 Ross:See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. Ive met him before?
 Ross:(realizing) That is Mark?
 Ross:I hate that guy.
 Ross:No no NO you cannot go to dinner with him.
 Ross:Oh yeah Im sure hes gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
 Ross:Im serious. I just dont trust that guy okay?
 Ross:Hey is Rachel here?
 Ross:Shes still at dinner?
 Ross:That guy Mark. From Bloomingdales... She thinks hes just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
 Ross:We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
 Ross:Hey so uhm... How was dinner?
 Ross:(speaking without pause agitated) Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
 Ross:Should we send something?
 Ross:Congratulations!
 Ross:Can we can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along huh? You didnt believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
 Ross:(gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
 Ross:So if you take this job youll be moving to Paris?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:All right well work it out.
 Ross:Yeah yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
 Ross:Well Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
 Ross:Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back she would take it?
 Ross:I dont know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
 Ross:I didnt say we were brothers.
 Ross:Yeah Im a friend of Rachel Greens. Uhm actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
 Ross:Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
 Ross:Uhm well... Im here to see if youll give Rachel her job back.
 Ross:Oh no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then well see if she wants to come back.
 Ross:Look she loved her job here. And lets face it youre not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isnt that true?
 Ross:(surprised) Huh I took a shot there.
 Ross:I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.) Is this your son?
 Ross:Oh nothing it’s just it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
 Ross:How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left just the two of us and he can touch anything he wants. (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
 Ross:You let Rachel come back and it’s done.
 Ross:Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear your kid is going to have the time of his life.
 Ross:He’ll be fine.
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:Nooo!
 Ross:So you’re not going to Paris.
 Ross:Wh… wh…what?
 Ross:Yeeeah! (They high-five)
 Ross:(enters) Its me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed) Look I um I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
 Ross:Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks hopeful)
 Ross:Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
 Ross:Huh? So? We have a deal?
 Ross:Yes! yes!
 Ross:Oh (grins) Believe me the ladies they love it!
 Ross:Good cause the ladies not so much. (shakes his head give him a thumbs up and leaves)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:They did?
 Ross:So what are you gonna do?
 Ross:Thats great! So youre staying in New York!
 Ross:Youre excited right?
 Ross:Right!
 Ross:Uhm I hadnt no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm I mean you said you were scared.
 Ross:(after a long pause) You should go.
 Ross:Its what you want. You should go.
 Ross:I really do.
 Ross:(picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) Im sure hell understand.
 Ross:Yeah...
 Ross:Yeah yeah oh! (They hug)
 Ross:Then Im happy too. (Theyre still hugging - fade out)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey Erica welcome back to town! (pause) Wow look how big youve gotten.
 Ross:Right no I understand.
 Ross:No no I knew (he stares at her breasts).
 Ross:She brought them up! (pause) I didnt realize you were coming back so soon!
 Ross:Hotel? Why isnt she staying with you guys?
 Ross:Erica those things arent free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
 Ross:Oh man I cant believe you guys are leaving this place.
 Ross:No no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
 Ross:Hey is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
 Ross:Mhm (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
 Ross:What are you guys doing?
 Ross:You got it! (Monica leaves Ross closes the door). All right shes right we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Lets put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
 Ross:Chandler you dont have a sister so you cant understand how much this bums me out.
 Ross:Bumming hard guys bumming hard.
 Ross:Yeah? Yeah where is it?
 Ross:Rock on!
 Ross:Hey wheres Rach?
 Ross:Great.
 Ross:Here she is!
 Ross:Oh man! I cant believe shes actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Hey what do you think theyre doing in there?
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?
 Ross:Are you kidding? Oh my God...
 Ross:Oh man Im not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.

 Ross:Its laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
 Ross:Nuh-uh.

 Ross:Was your basket on top?
 Ross:So?
 Ross:No suds? Excuse me hold on a second. (to woman) Thats my friends machine.
 Ross:Hey hey hey thats not the rule and you know it.

 Ross:Rach have you never done this before?
 Ross:Uh well dont worry Ill use the gentle cycle. Ok um basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites a whole nother machine for colors and a third for your uh your uh delicates and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
 Ross:(visibly nervous) Uh that that that would be a judgment call.
 Ross:That does not sound stupid to me. You know its like the first time I had to make dinner for myself after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) Im sorry thats all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
 Ross:(not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh uh-oh the laundrys done. Its uh its a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundrys done uh-oh uh-oh.

 Ross:You got the clothes clean. Now thats the important part.
 Ross:You were incredible! Brand new woman ladies and gentlemen.

 Ross:He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
 Ross:Cmon! Cmon!
 Ross:No of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah yeah it is.
 Ross:Well yknow monogamy can be a uh tricky concept. I mean anthropologically speaking-
 Ross:Fine. Fine alright now youll never know.
 Ross:Alright. Theres a theory put forth by Richard Leakey-
 Ross:Oh yeah nobody knows. And were not supposed to ask.
 Ross:Oh cmon! When we were kids yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasnt raggedy!
 Ross:Alright you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives but you dont pay it right away.
 Ross:Because youre a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
 Ross:Monica? Youre Mom.
 Ross:Cmon seriously Joey whats the part?
 Ross:Youre right youre right it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
 Ross:Look at it this way you dumped her. Right? I mean this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful intelligent unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?

 Ross:The ride broke down. So Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
 Ross:Step back.
 Ross:Well it was the only thing to do there that didnt have a line.
 Ross:Come on.
 Ross:(sarcastically) And you didnt marry him because...?
 Ross:Probably. But you know Ill tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
 Ross:It is. Eventually it kind of... burns out. But hopefully what youre left with is trust and security and... well in the case of my ex-wife lesbianism. So you know for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing theres all that other good stuff.
 Ross:But um... I dont think thats going to be you.
 Ross:Uh-uh. See I see.... big passion in your future.
 Ross:Mmmm.
 Ross:I do.
 Ross:(innocently) What?
 Ross:(acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
 Ross:No no no. Im not in the zone.
 Ross:Im taking my time alright? Im laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean every day I get just a little bit closer to...

 Ross:Well maybe its cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
 Ross:Oh god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)

 Ross:Well ahem... you know by the time wed finished with all the dirty talk it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted so uh...
 Ross:Yeah which was nice.
 Ross:I don’t know whether he’s testing me or just acting out but my monkey is out of control. But he keeps erasing the messages on my machine supposedly by accident.
 Ross:And then like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and peed all over the crossword.
 Ross:Oh Pheebs I’m sorry I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.
 Ross:No Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads we’ve got lesbians the whole parenting team.

 Ross:Hi did you order some bananas?
 Ross:Gimme back my monkey.
 Ross:Marcel? Marcel? Okay where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?

 Ross:Are you insane? Cmere Marcel cmon. (Marcel starts to go to him)
 Ross:Cmere Marcel. (Turns to Ross)
 Ross:Okay gimme my monkey back.
 Ross:Alright I want my monkey.
 Ross:(To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school you couldntve been fat.
 Ross:Itll be nice to get this off finally wont it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now thats fine.
 Ross:Listen Im- Im sorry I was so hard on you before its just I...
 Ross:Yeah but you were the one who got him back yknow? You you were great. ...Hey we uh we still have that uh that bottle of wine. You in the mood for uh something grape?
 Ross:Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The uh the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well so long as were here and uh not on the subject I was thinking about uh how mad we got at each other before and um I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we um...
 Ross:We have got to start locking that door!
 Ross:I dont know you dont wanna mess with corn nuts. Theyre craaazy.
 Ross:I cant believe it! Hes looking right at us!
 Ross:Okay okay whats going on?
 Ross:Yeah well does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
 Ross:What? What? What?!
 Ross:Thats nice... now was that before or after you told him to stop calling stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone hmm?
 Ross:Thats thats nice twice!
 Ross:What was with the dishes?
 Ross:...desperate needy pathetic?
 Ross:You-you had what?
 Ross:What uh... what were you thinking?
 Ross:No! No no it is nothing like me and Carol!
 Ross:Its its its uh a totally diferent situation! Its its apples and oranges its its orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
 Ross:(leaving) I just have to go all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life I have a jam packed schedule and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
 Ross:Four letters Circle or hoop.
 Ross:Thanks.

 Ross:Five letters.

 Ross:Second date!
 Ross:I think when someone steals your credit card theyve kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
 Ross:Marcel stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachels room) come here Marcel-
 Ross:What? Its its just a phase.
 Ross:Would you all relax? Its not that big a deal.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(Mortified) Hi.
 Ross:At the vet.
 Ross:She says Marcels humping things not a phase. Apparently hes reached sexual maturity.
 Ross:She says as time goes on hes gonna start getting agressive and violent.
 Ross:Im gonna have to give him up.
 Ross:I know. I know. I mean one day hes this little thing and before you know it hes this little thing I cant get off my leg.
 Ross:No no. The vet says unless hes in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin hes just gonna get vicious. Ive just gotta get him into a zoo.
 Ross:Well were applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos yknow like uh San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream because yknow hes out of state. Uh my vet uh knows someone at Miami so thats a possibility.
 Ross:What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. Shes a stealer.
 Ross:Yeah which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
 Ross:(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didnt get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I dont know who this is harder on me or him.
 Ross:Marcel! Marcel! Marcel no! Good boy. See how can nobody want him?
 Ross:Where exactly is your zoo?
 Ross:Yes.
 Ross:No-no hes hes very docile.
 Ross:Well I I dont know. Why?
 Ross:He can hold a banana if thats whatcha mean...
 Ross:Why- why- why would he need a blade?
 Ross:Hes in! Oh did you hear that Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
 Ross:Aww. Thank you Aunt Phoebe.
 Ross:Just just say what you feel.
 Ross:That was good.
 Ross:Uh if you guys dont mind Id like to take a moment just me and him.
 Ross:Marcel cmere cmere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy this is it. Theres just a coupla things I want to say. Im really gonna miss you and Im never gonna forget about you. Youve been more than just a pet to me youve been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay Marcel please could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel would- okay just take him away. Just take him.
 Ross:Why why why would you dream that?
 Ross:I love it when we share.
 Ross:I cant belive you two had sex in her dream.
 Ross:Pheebs why would you want to operate a drill press?

 Ross:Well then I think I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
 Ross:You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing and adorable and sexy you are you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking Oh my god Im with Rachel. You know someone who makes you feel good the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer but hearing that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?

 Ross:I did not freak out.
 Ross:Because its breast milk. Its gross.
 Ross:No no Carol. Theres nothing wrong with it. I just I just dont think breast milk is for adults.

 Ross:(to Isabella) Hi! Hi I’m Ross you don’t know me but I’m a big big fan of yours. I mean Blue Velvet woo-oo hoo! Um I was wondering if I could um maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
 Ross:Well yeah kinda. Um but that’s okay see we have an understanding um see we each have this list of five famous people (gets his out) so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No no no it’s flattery.
 Ross:Oh no no no wait wait Isabella. Don’t don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
 Ross:Um yeah.
 Ross:Um no.
 Ross:But okay.
 Ross:Um see but that’s not the final draft.
 Ross:Yeah um okay see you were you were on the list but my friend Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international so I bumped you for Wynona Rider local.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.
 Ross:I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
 Ross:Yeah I’ll take some.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Hey yknow while we’re on that when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
 Ross:Phoebe she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:So how many more do you have tomorrow?
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Sure your dresser is missing but this she notices.
 Ross:I have to go. Yeah Carol should be home by now soo...
 Ross:Oh better actually. Yknow I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
 Ross:Yeah yknow how I have you guys well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers but last week she meet this woman at the gym Susan something and they really hit it off and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference
 Ross:No real- honey really it’s fine just g-go with Susan. Really I no I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay okay bye
 Ross:I don’t know something girlie.
 Ross:(all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
 Ross:My marriage I think my marriage is um is kinda over.
 Ross:‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.
 Ross:(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink many drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d she’d see some beautiful woman and and she’d be Ross yknow look at her and I’d think God my wife is cool!
 Ross:Well now I do!!
 Ross:Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....
 Ross:Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing or I’d paid more attention or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
 Ross:Wait wait wait wait wait.
 Ross:Wait wait wait.
 Ross:My foot is stuck in the pocket.
 Ross:No I can’t get it out.
 Ross:No come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!
 Ross:Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
 Ross:Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
 Ross:Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
 Ross:My wife’s a lesbian.
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:So I told Carl ‘Nobody no matter how famous their parents are nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....
 Ross:Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days who were you? I was always Richie.
 Ross:We?
 Ross:Oh shoot tomorrow’s not so good I’m supposed to um fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.

 Ross:Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
 Ross:Ugh museum.
 Ross:There never was a library. I mean there are libraries its just that I ah I never worked at one.
 Ross:Yeah if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke I made a joke.
 Ross:It’s not a library...
 Ross:So Dr. Green how’s the old boat.
 Ross:It gives it a nice antiquey look.
 Ross:Wow. I’m sorry when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that)
 Ross:Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
 Ross:Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
 Ross:That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.
 Ross:So?
 Ross:You really serve people sneezers?
 Ross:Thanks again Dr. Green.
 Ross:Oh ah you don’t need that.
 Ross:The carbon it’s messy I mean it gets on your fingers and causes the the ah night blindness.
 Ross:Oh yeah that would be me um I have I have a problem I-I tip way too much way way too much it’s a sickness really.
 Ross:I know.
 Ross:Nothing I do means anything really.
 Ross:Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.
 Ross:Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.
 Ross:Yeah I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
 Ross:Hey Pheebs what are you doing?
 Ross:Look honey I have tried to make nice it doesn’t work.
 Ross:Look sweetie I could be the bigger man I could be the biggest man I could be a big huge giant man and it still wouldn’t make any difference except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’
 Ross:Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it okay we’re never gonna get along.
 Ross:Okay okay okay. (hugs her) I’ll get the bagels.
 Ross:Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand and Dr. Green puts his scarf on it.)
 Ross:Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
 Ross:(to Rachel) Okay that’s it I can’t take it anymore.
 Ross:Oh please. Sweetie it’s hopeless okay I’m just gonna go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)
 Ross:Look look I’m sorry. It’s just that....
 Ross:Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.
 Ross:Uh.

 Ross:So what’s a matter you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.
 Ross:Why? Why can’t you go to him?
 Ross:Pheebs come on you didn’t kill anybody these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s it’s it’s just ah a coincidence.
 Ross:Thanks Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm can I get a napkin too?

 Ross:What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how how are you going to tell Chandler?
 Ross:Okay I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
 Ross:Well they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing then they rearranged the figures let’s just leave it at that.
 Ross:Yes that’s what I was going to ask thank you.
 Ross:You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths ‘Don’t worry I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’d be great no I just wanted to ask Monica because I know how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hmm?
 Ross:Joey Homo Sapiens are people.
 Ross:(entering) Hey! Everyone.
 Ross:How’s my little boy?
 Ross:(noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do take him whaling?
 Ross:Oh my God he just said your name that’s great! Good job Ben.
 Ross:And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.
 Ross:Well he’s finally alseep. About that ah bump on his head?
 Ross:It’s okay if he bumps his head kids bump their heads all the time yknow it was your first time babysitting I figured you did the best you could.
 Ross:I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.
 Ross:Monica did it?
 Ross:Monica?
 Ross:Umm did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
 Ross:Well I was just playing with him and yknow we were doing the alphabet song which he used to be really good at but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah I don’t know fell out of his head.
 Ross:Oh and also he’s he’s walkin’ kind of funny his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg and he’s in there just sort of yknow... (walks around in a circle)
 Ross:Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
 Ross:Can we please focus here a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
 Ross:He does not look happy.
 Ross:Halftime.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Um Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.
 Ross:It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
 Ross:Whoa whoa whoa ho ho ho you did not win the game the touchdown didn’t count because of the spectacularly illegal oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
 Ross:Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?
 Ross:Yes it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said ‘nobody won that game ‘ and he was sick of our fighting so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.
 Ross:Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
 Ross:Can I see you for a second?
 Ross:All right we’re gonna play.
 Ross:Here you go. (throws her the ball)
 Ross:Sweetie don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.
 Ross:Sweetie now I pick you.

 Ross:Yeah losers talk!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Okay (to Chandler) this play I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
 Ross:You you go long.
 Ross:Until we start to look very small.
 Ross:Break!!
 Ross:One-Mississippi two-Mississippi switch! Switch! Switch!!
 Ross:Uh hello it’s third down.
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
 Ross:Okay it’s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you need.

 Ross:That cup is mine!
 Ross:Chandler! Chandler!
 Ross:Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?
 Ross:Okay you wanna play rough we can play rough.
 Ross:Hey where’d you get that?
 Ross:It’s no surprise that your winning ‘cause you got to pick first so you got the better team.
 Ross:What?! The guys against the girls? See that’s ridiculous Monica because I’m only down by three touchdowns.
 Ross:Fine fine Rachel your with Monica Joey you’re with me.
 Ross:Right. Okay let’s play. Let’s go.
 Ross:Enough with geography for the insane okay? Let’s play some ball guys.
 Ross:Okay yknow what let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi which of my boys do you like?

 Ross:Hey! It’s 42-21!
 Ross:Let go! Let go!
 Ross:No! You let go!
 Ross:How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
 Ross:Hey! It’s starting to snow.
 Ross:Gimme the this!
 Ross:Just admit it Chandler you have no backhand.
 Ross:Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
 Ross:All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs knocking her down they both watch in horror.)
 Ross:I know. I feel horrible. Okay.

 Ross:So this must be kinda neat for ya huh? I mean your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school and you you ah don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.
 Ross:Wow you ah you really like all this space stuff huh?

 Ross:Huh. Well good luck to Dad. Say how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Four hundred huh? Well that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) How much are the boxes?

 Ross:Well that makes sense.
 Ross:Yeah Sarah anything.
 Ross:Hi I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.
 Ross:No hi I’m I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)
 Ross:Ah well it means that I can sell cookies but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.
 Ross:No please please um it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
 Ross:Okay okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)
 Ross:All right!!
 Ross:...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters Santa Rudolph and Baby Jesus.
 Ross:Wait a minute one box! Come on I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler what about you?
 Ross:No but ah there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what I’ll put you down for eight boxes one for each night.
 Ross:Mon?
 Ross:Ah no Mon Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah yknow I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.
 Ross:Oh come on now you know you want ‘em.
 Ross:I’ll tell you what Mon I’ll give you the first box for free.

 Ross:Ah we’re out. I sold them all.
 Ross:Monica I’m cutting you off.
 Ross:Mon look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
 Ross:Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
 Ross:Okay the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me the key to my success ‘the munchies.’ So I ah started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me Cookie Dude!
 Ross:Well hey who did these resumes for ya?
 Ross:Well you sure used a large font.

 Ross:Hey now! That was an accident okay.
 Ross:What’s a scrud?
 Ross:I don’t have too. I can just look at you.
 Ross:(to himself) Not nice enough.
 Ross:(to himself) Good for a scrud.
 Ross:That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the salute)
 Ross:Hi there!
 Ross:Um that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
 Ross:Well I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz and sold over 2000 boxes.
 Ross:Oh come here sweetie listen you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposed to come out.
 Ross:That word was swans.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:I’m I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp and I’m hoping that maybe somehow this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump up their apartment is decorated like outer space one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)
 Ross:Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by for mission countdown!
 Ross:Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’s head.)
 Ross:Real magic does exist.
 Ross:Ah somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.
 Ross:Hey Chandler there’s a party tomorrow you’ll feel better then.
 Ross:Oh somebody’s feeling better.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:What so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
 Ross:And he’s he’s a total stranger?
 Ross:Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
 Ross:Well I’m just saying I mean why else would he just yknow swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
 Ross:Hey Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?

 Ross:Yeah. So um I-I heard about this ah Mark guy that ah Rachel met today.
 Ross:Oh yeah! So ah kinda pretty pretty good. He sounds like a nice good guy.
 Ross:That’s excellent.
 Ross:(to Rachel) So he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice! (points to Chandler) This is men!!
 Ross:Which one is Gina?
 Ross:That’s okay.
 Ross:Hey Joey.
 Ross:Ah which which one?
 Ross:Mary-Angela.
 Ross:Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
 Ross:All right look look you’ve got to do this yourself okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela okay when which ever one she is comes to the door you take her for a walk you let her down easy.
 Ross:Where in Cuba?
 Ross:Bummer.
 Ross:No I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look Rach I want only good things for you.
 Ross:But you you don’t want to seem too pushy.

 Ross:That’s right good things that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)
 Ross:That is so made up!
 Ross:There you go.

 Ross:High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.
 Ross:You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
 Ross:‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well thank you very much! Yknow now he is going to prep her yknow prep her as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
 Ross:Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.

 Ross:I’m sorry okay I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself and this morning I was so I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
 Ross:Listen. Oh hey hey the important thing was that she meant she meant nothing to me!
 Ross:Look I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
 Ross:That for all I knew would could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
 Ross:Look I’m not trying to get out of anything okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
 Ross:Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
 Ross:Look Rachel I wanted to tell you I thought I should I-I did and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
 Ross:Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?
 Ross:(pause) Yes I would.
 Ross:(less sure) Yes.
 Ross:(covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay okay yeah I would have been devastated but I would still want to be with you. Because it’s I mean it’s you.
 Ross:What? Come on Rach tell me what you’re thinking?
 Ross:Order a pizza like ‘I forgive you?’
 Ross:Hey can I can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.
 Ross:No anchovies.
 Ross:That’s okay I’ll just pick ‘em off.
 Ross:You can have the last piece if you want.
 Ross:What now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel I-I’m sorry okay I’m sorry I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right I that’s not me I’m not Joey!
 Ross:Yknow what yknow what I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that that break okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that that ran when things got just a little rough!
 Ross:That’s what?!
 Ross:Okay well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look I (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible stupid stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry I wish I could take it back but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel I love you so much.
 Ross:Okay okay okay.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(moving over to stand in front of her) Okay okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...
 Ross:Look look there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without without these arms and your face and this heart. Your good heart Rach (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and and....
 Ross:(crying) Yeah but this can’t be it I mean.
 Ross:Look you guys I just wanna say I really really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now so I just wanna say thanks.
 Ross:Oh hey hey huh how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh huh what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts it’ll be great!

 Ross:Exactly it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
 Ross:And so now you guys are gonna be married?

 Ross:Phoebe 800 is toll free 801 is-is Utah.
 Ross:What happened?
 Ross:Yeah anything goes except ah eye gouging and fish hooking.
 Ross:Huh what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek yknow like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey sarcastic) Thanks man that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
 Ross:(on phone) That’s right Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah we have the reservations.
 Ross:(stunned) Dude what are you doing?
 Ross:All right so Chandler from now on don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Yknow just ah don’t turn your back to him.
 Ross:(walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!
 Ross:Yeah it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah I saved thirty cents plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
 Ross:Well then that guy is in serious serious trouble.
 Ross:All right! You go get him! Let’s go!
 Ross:Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
 Ross:Hot dog?
 Ross:What? Oh! I gotta tell you I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now but she’s really terrific.

 Ross:Ahh the one next to my foot. Sorry.
 Ross:Okay we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah did your boss try to slap you again today?

 Ross:Yeah? What about ah that bike messenger you hit?
 Ross:Yeah I think she looks good.
 Ross:Go go go!

(he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five and let’s see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
 Ross:Whoa hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
 Ross:Okay.

 Ross:Uh Pheebs some people call that breaking and entering.
 Ross:Wh-haa-haa! Look what ‘cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing.)
 Ross:Nooo but it but it’s great.

 Ross:That’s not true! Her she doesn’t even know what she wants! Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
 Ross:I know but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
 Ross:Good night.
 Ross:Okey-dokey!
 Ross:Hey it’ll grow back right? And she-she’s really fun and she’s cool and-and I’m finally moving on. Yknow? I mean getting over Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound) yknow? Yknow and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there and-and I kiss her and Gooood I wanna kiss her and-and-and it doesn’t work out right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)
 Ross:(surprised) Hi!
 Ross:Awww.
 Ross:Yeah. (closes the door and goes over and kisses Rachel.)
 Ross:I know.
 Ross:(stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay I gotta go.
 Ross:Well I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
 Ross:Well yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.
 Ross:No she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
 Ross:Whoa-oh okay! Yeah why am I telling you that?
 Ross:Yeah yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:It’s over.
 Ross:Well it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
 Ross:Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again but she turns away.)
 Ross:Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow it’s-it’s 530 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So I’d better get cracking on this baby.
 Ross:Okay I’ll be up in (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
 Ross:Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)
 Ross:Done!
 Ross:Well I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very very important to you to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully twice!
 Ross:I’m sorry.
 Ross:Does it? Does it? Yeah I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.
 Ross:(interrupting) No Rach no. I don’t I don’t I don’t have to think about it in fact I’ve decided I’ve decided that that it.......does.
 Ross:Oh sure! I’m sure.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What happened?
 Ross:It does. It really and truly does.
 Ross:(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
 Ross:She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
 Ross:Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault and she she says here (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”
 Ross:(calming down) Yeah I know. I mean no you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
 Ross:What the hell happened on that beach?!
 Ross:(coming back in with Rachel) Hey you guys! What do you what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
 Ross:What happened? Joey?
 Ross:Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
 Ross:I missed you too.
 Ross:(getting miffed) I suppose.
 Ross:(getting angry) Umm-hmm.
 Ross:(yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
 Ross:And for the record it took two people to break up this relationship!!
 Ross:I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
 Ross:I fell asleep!
 Ross:It was 530 in the morning and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room trapping Monica Chandler and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh and by the way Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
 Ross:(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
 Ross:Oh no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
 Ross:Who’s Chip?
 Ross:The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
 Ross:Monica you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in school!!
 Ross:(to Rachel) I was just leaving.
 Ross:Why? Did you write it?
 Ross:Well ah actually...
 Ross:Well umm why don’t you give him a call?
 Ross:Oh I’m sure.
 Ross:(whispering in her ear) Oh that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing!
 Ross:(reading the newspaper) Hey here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
 Ross:I’m reading your ad.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Good so do I
 Ross:Are you sure she’s in the cat or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
 Ross:So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
 Ross:So Pheebs how long is your mom gonna be with us?
 Ross:So guys am I crazy or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?
 Ross:Come on you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!
 Ross:No you don’t.
 Ross:No you do—yknow what you’re not gonna suck me into this.
 Ross:I do not always have to be—okay okay. (starts to leave)
 Ross:(taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.
 Ross:Yes we have to tell her!
 Ross:(holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay yknow what I have to go have dinner with my son can I trust that when you see Phoebe you will tell her.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:(entering) Hey! So ah what did the insurance company say?
 Ross:(seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay fine! Pheebs?
 Ross:Hi! Listen uhh this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
 Ross:No! No! Look—Hey enough is enough! Look I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
 Ross:None.
 Ross:I’m sorry.
 Ross:I don’t know what to say.
 Ross:(goes over to Julio) Come here here come here come here (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry about what I said umm it was it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit of my friend’s mother.
 Ross:Oh! Yknow I’ve got an extra futon.
 Ross:So why don’t you quit?
 Ross:Who is Maria?
 Ross:You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
 Ross:So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
 Ross:They make you take an oath?
 Ross:Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
 Ross:Whoa-whoa-whoa hey! Now remember what we talked about you gotta be strong.
 Ross:One more time Hey don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?
 Ross:Good! That’s good!
 Ross:Me? No.
 Ross:It’s okay man be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)
 Ross:No! And I’m not gonna be so you can save you little speech.
 Ross:And that’s funny why?
 Ross:Or! Or we could go to the bank close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
 Ross:And that’s not against your oath?!
 Ross:Hello.
 Ross:We’d like to close our accounts.
 Ross:No-no.
 Ross:No! And somehow we ended up with a joint checking account.
 Ross:So why don’t you quit?
 Ross:Who is Maria?
 Ross:You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
 Ross:So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
 Ross:They make you take an oath?

(Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops I almost lost this baby! Yeah the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachels face.

 Ross:Ive seen her at work but I always figured ah-huh? But uh I made her dinner. We had a great time. And were going out again tomorrow.
 Ross:Fine by me; hope she wins.
 Ross:How do you think its gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
 Ross:So uh why did you have to turn it down?

 Ross:Well I do! Why dont we go back to my place light a couple of candles break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties uh...
 Ross:Oh yeah why not?
 Ross:You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
 Ross:Well like that only instead of a chair its a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket its a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day its the end of time and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.
 Ross:What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
 Ross:No I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.

 Ross:Okay guys.
 Ross:Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know umm you should-you should think of umm my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…

 Ross:(with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys…
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Hey!
 Ross:Oh thanks thanks. So Monica tells me that uh you don’t want to play anymore because me and yknow my talent. Is that true?
 Ross:Pheebs…
 Ross:See but Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire and if it bothers you this much then I… I won’t play anymore.
 Ross:Yeah okay.
 Ross:Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:No the-the sad thing is if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her knowing Joey he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.
 Ross:Well I said-I said something to Phoebe.
 Ross:Hey would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
 Ross:Thank you thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah I lost it. Y’know I’m not gonna play anymore (to Phoebe) would you can you finish my set?
 Ross:Yeah like I could lose it.
 Ross:I played bad on purpose guys.

 Ross:Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
 Ross:Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don’t know why I do that.
 Ross:Hey-hey I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
 Ross:So listen ah I picked Monica for secret Santa but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah I was wondering if you wanna switch.
 Ross:Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice what are you gonna get me?
 Ross:Yeah well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
 Ross:Oh that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.
 Ross:Like uh that gold necklace I got her last year.
 Ross:Well she wore it all Christmas day and then uh…
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:What are you doing?
 Ross:Everything? Even the TV?
 Ross:Listen Joey I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?
 Ross:That’s a good point. So uh how long are you gonna punish him?
 Ross:You’ve sentenced him?!
 Ross:Joey the guy’s your best friend.
 Ross:Oh who? Me?
 Ross:Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
 Ross:I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
 Ross:He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hey yknow Mon if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son you’d be able to tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather.
 Ross:(to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
 Ross:I just wanna check something.
 Ross:(He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now we’ll see.
 Ross:(grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold this one is silver.
 Ross:Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
 Ross:What did you get?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Like ‘em like ‘em? Or I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?
 Ross:Sure! Oh and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
 Ross:There’s nothing the matter with me. See I’m not completely devoid of sentiment see I have feelings.
 Ross:I don’t know what to say I’m sorry. Though you’re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old we we actually we had people looking for that.
 Ross:He’s taking her purse!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:I’m sorry I’m late did I miss anything?
 Ross:15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles no!)
 Ross:Oh on a date. Yeah I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
 Ross:Okay it was just me and her at the back of the train and I sat near the door so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
 Ross:No I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great but she’s like totally great but she lives two and a half hours away.
 Ross:Oh wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
 Ross:You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
 Ross:Not her. Yeah this is someone else I meet and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie even though she’s a two hour train ride away is really pretty really smart and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl well she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s well she’s-she’s just as pretty I guess she’s smart she’s not fun.
 Ross:Well I-I want to give her another chance y’know? She lives so close. And at the end of the date the other time she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand if she wasn’t kidding she’s not fun she’s stupid and kind of a racist.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:I wasn’t sleeping.
 Ross:The one with the cat. I gotta go I’ve got another date.
 Ross:No it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.
 Ross:Y’know you’re right. Thank you.
 Ross:(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
 Ross:Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait so so you live in Montreal?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:I’m sorry I’m late did I miss anything?
 Ross:15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles no!)
 Ross:Oh on a date. Yeah I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
 Ross:Okay it was just me and her at the back of the train and I sat near the door so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.

 Ross:Y’know you’re right. Thank you.
 Ross:(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
 Ross:Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait so so you live in Montreal?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Uh actually Joey it’s the Cretasous period.
 Ross:My God!
 Ross:Pheebs you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot I mean morning sickness uhh labour and it’s all for somebody else!
 Ross:Well the stuff I just mentioned.
 Ross:That is really nice…lying! No way is that the reason!
 Ross:And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes.
 Ross:Yeah I was going for the metaphor.
 Ross:Just go for it Chandler.
 Ross:That’s okay I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later Joey. (Joey is shocked.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey uh I’m really really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
 Ross:But hey it’s not just me I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
 Ross:It’s like that everywhere Joey! Okay Mon back me up here. Where you work the uh waiters eat with the waiters right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs right?
 Ross:Thank you Dr. Phillips but I’m having my lunch at this table here in the middle. I’m having lunch right here with my good friend Joey if he’ll sit with me.
 Ross:Yknow we work in a museum of natural history and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now I look around this cafeteria and y’know what I see I see-I see division. Division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers and I ask myself My God why?! Now I say we shed these-these coats that separate us and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat and throws it down.) I’m Ross! I’m divorced and I have a kid!
 Ross:All right there you go!
 Ross:Okay good-good for you.
 Ross:Wow Rhonda.
 Ross:Yeah okay Scott!

 Ross:No-no-no I-I wanna play.
 Ross:The test is ready.
 Ross:Okay each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay the categories are Fears and Pet Peeves Ancient History Literature and It’s All Relative. Now the coin toss to see who goes first. (He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him to see who goes first.) Okay somebody call it this time.
 Ross:It’s heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen pick your category.
 Ross:What is Monica’s biggest pet peeve?
 Ross:That’s correct. Ladies?
 Ross:According to Chandler what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
 Ross:That is correct.
 Ross:Gentlemen you’re pick.

 Ross:So you were right?
 Ross:Chandler!
 Ross:He’s right what she did was unforgivable.
 Ross:How might you be wrong?
 Ross:That’s all you’re basing this on?
 Ross:So the first time you ask a guy out he-he turns you down?

 Ross:You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy hmm that-that is a toughie.
 Ross:All right I’ll do it.
 Ross:Please hurry.
 Ross:When we first met her she was soaking her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes she was a totally different person.
 Ross:I’ve gotta go there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!
 Ross:Hey! You were so right!
 Ross:Uh what you said about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
 Ross:I mean I I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…
 Ross:Joshua…guy at that club dancing and having a good time the thought of it kinda…y’know.
 Ross:But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!

 Ross:Oh Liam. So uh what were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it (In an English accent) football?
 Ross:What’s ah what’s so funny about that?
 Ross:Well we didn’t have freedom here until 1776 either so…
 Ross:Cheers!
 Ross:Oh just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.
 Ross:(shocked) Hey!
 Ross:Hey I can handle it! All right?
 Ross:That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.
 Ross:And is a hum kinda like a scruddle?
 Ross:Well you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean he’s like Joe Rugby.
 Ross:Anyway she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!
 Ross:Look don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh I’ll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
 Ross:They don’t look any bigger than me!
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:Okay I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know Red Ross!
 Ross:Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
 Ross:You’ll see.
 Ross:JOEY!!!!!!
 Ross:Did you see me? I was pretty good huh? That is one fun game!
 Ross:(to Emily) Hey could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
 Ross:Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m dying. I really do.
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well okay I gotta have some more fun!
 Ross:(whines No.) That’s not true!
 Ross:What? No! No I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!
 Ross:I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
 Ross:No God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
 Ross:I like that.
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:All right bad ankle got it!
 Ross:Yeah? I can use that trick hip no cup okay! Okay!
 Ross:But-but Liam’s on my team.
 Ross:I’m gonna go get him! Okay I am going back in! (Squeals like a madman.)
 Ross:Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet it’s in my pocket.
 Ross:No not you. (Emily gets it.)
 Ross:Oh I kinda was wasn’t I?
 Ross:I made a man twice my size cry. I mean I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.
 Ross:Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but I really am. And it’s all because of you wonderful amazing you.
 Ross:No no I’m serious. Thank you.
 Ross:It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what you know what? It’s not.
 Ross:Oh we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Bye. (They kiss.)
 Ross:Oh yeah she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days I don’t have to do it.
 Ross:Yeah she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together and that’s it. Y’know.
 Ross:Pheebs!
 Ross:(starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!
 Ross:Well as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean she’s going to come by first to say good-bye and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry no party.
 Ross:You really didn’t know?
 Ross:(interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
 Ross:Yeah but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know then The Plaza for dinner.
 Ross:No-no-no no umm actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually Surprise! And then Oh my God I’m so surprised—good-bye!
 Ross:Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)
 Ross:Yes we have something we have to get to.
 Ross:What big thing?
 Ross:(stopping them) Okay that-that’s enough! Y’know let’s let’s let someone else play.
 Ross:Okay we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
 Ross:That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned so…
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Helps a little.
 Ross:Yeah have a seat.
 Ross:That’s okay I mean it was just two-week thing anyway I just didn’t want it to end this way y’know?
 Ross:What do you mean?
 Ross:Yeah I really do. Yeah but what am I gonna do I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing y’know no commitment.
 Ross:You think?
 Ross:Hey you’re right.
 Ross:Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
 Ross:Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:So uh Emily just went to the airport.
 Ross:Eh her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know we-we said our good-byes this morning so…
 Ross:(Thinks about it.) Nah.
 Ross:Well I that’s the thing I don’t know! I mean whenever I brought it up with her she said (In a British accent.) This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…
 Ross:And why do you care so much?
 Ross:You had fantasies about Emily?
 Ross:Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
 Ross:Ahh.
 Ross:We said it was only going to be two weeks y’know?
 Ross:What-what is love really?
 Ross:I am a good kisser.
 Ross:Emily! (Runs up.)
 Ross:I just I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
 Ross:That’s that’s that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.
 Ross:(stops her) Wait uh listen. I-I I have to tell you something. Umm I’ve been thinking I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah I-I think I love you.
 Ross:That’s no problem.
 Ross:I did.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:She said Thank you. I said I love you. And she said Thank you.
 Ross:What do I do now?
 Ross:She already lives in London.
 Ross:Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call it is definitely over! No wait. Wait. Unless eventually I call her y’know just to she what’s going on and and she says she’ll call me back but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.
 Ross:(Answers the phone.) Hello?
 Ross:Emily hi! Uh how-how was you flight?
 Ross:No no that-that that’s all right. Umm I’m just glad you called.
 Ross:Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
 Ross:She doesn’t know which one of us she wants me or this Colin guy.
 Ross:Well…
 Ross:I’m not proving anything. Okay I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!
 Ross:No I missed and hit the door. But it opened really hard!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:I made fun of his accent.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:All right. All right I’m gonna do it!
 Ross:I’m gonna I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.
 Ross:(on phone) Hey.
 Ross:No because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
 Ross:About four hours.
 Ross:(yelling thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Ohh! Thank you.

 Ross:Oh no-no-no see that-that clock’s a little fast uh we have 17 minutes. Huh what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
 Ross:Hey uh you can ignore that.

 Ross:Hey they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?
 Ross:How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
 Ross:What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.
 Ross:Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?
 Ross:Actually that-that’s not true in The Incredible Hulk uh No. 72 Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know ugh nevermind my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)
 Ross:(opening the door.) Hey!
 Ross:Well I asked him if he wanted to eat he said No. I asked him if he wanted to sleep he said No. I asked him what he wanted to do he said No. So he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)
 Ross:So umm any word from Susan?
 Ross:Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh by the by did it uh did it ever occur to you that I don’t know maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
 Ross:Y’know the kind of fun you and Susan had when we were married.
 Ross:Am I?!
 Ross:Am I?!
 Ross:Uh-huh Carol so were we. All right just-just imagine for a moment Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks they’re laughing y’know someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?
 Ross:OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!
 Ross:(returning from the phone.) So I just picked up a message from Emily she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
 Ross:So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!
 Ross:Oh wake up!
 Ross:Excuse me?
 Ross:Look I don’t know what you’re talking about I am not a crazy jealous person.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:It does not!
 Ross:This is not fun!
 Ross:Well I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
 Ross:Nice luggage.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Oh I missed you too.
 Ross:(To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
 Ross:Huh? I know I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around pretending like he’s jamming.)
 Ross:Uh I don’t know whatever.
 Ross:Oh I know. Y’know what I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy I love that guy! I mean I love you too a lot but that guy! I-I love that guy!

 Ross:One more day seriously/
 Ross:So then you can stay as long as you want.
 Ross:Oh no. Don’t don’t don’t start packing. Come on! (She puts some clothes into her bag and Ross throws them out.)
 Ross:Yeah I know I uh I tried them on.
 Ross:No. No I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.
 Ross:(entering) Hey guys! (They both notice his new little friend)
 Ross:Oh yeah Emily convinced me to do it.
 Ross:I like it and Emily likes it and that’s what counts. So uh how are you guys doing?
 Ross:Ugh she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.
 Ross:Yeah!! Yeah!
 Ross:I just I hate this so much! I mean every time I go pick her up at the airport it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking Well I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days dropping her off.
 Ross:Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean she lives there I live here. I mean she-she’d have to uh move here. She should move here!
 Ross:I could ask her to live with me!
 Ross:I mean why not! I mean I mean why not?!
 Ross:Look guys when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her y’know?

 Ross:Smooth man. Yeah you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.) Well I just want to say thanks everyone this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.
 Ross:Oh thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey guys!
 Ross:I just wanted to thank you again for last night what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before so…
 Ross:Yeah right!
 Ross:That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
 Ross:Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
 Ross:My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
 Ross:(dialling the phone) All right-all right fine! I-I’m gonna call the cops!
 Ross:Not on you! On the stripper!
 Ross:Okay well we’ll call the company that sent her!
 Ross:So what Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well how could this happen?!
 Ross:Diverse.
 Ross:Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
 Ross:We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
 Ross:Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
 Ross:Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring kisses it and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)
 Ross:No that’s all right.
 Ross:Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man and I want both you guys.
 Ross:Hey both you guys should be up there with me. I mean you two are-are my… I mean I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting emotional.)
 Ross:Total wuss!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Hey! Are you ready yet?
 Ross:Oh! Got ‘em right here (Pats his coat pocket) check!
 Ross:Yeah cheerie-o!
 Ross:Well we’re all here! I guess we should get going!
 Ross:Oh I’ll-I’ll come hug you.
 Ross:Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:(to Rachel) So we’re off.
 Ross:Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh I can’t believe you’re not gonna be there!
 Ross:So-so come! Why don’t you come?
 Ross:To London! Come to London. Please? It’ll mean so much to me.
 Ross:Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?
 Ross:This is my wedding.
 Ross:Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.
 Ross:All right let’s go! Bye Pheebs!
 Ross:Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey okay?
 Ross:What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!
 Ross:Sweetie you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great okay? Come on. Come on.
 Ross:Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah. Yes this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.
 Ross:It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.
 Ross:Uh-huh I see that.
 Ross:What? What?
 Ross:Hey! I just spoke to your dad and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
 Ross:Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
 Ross:She said what?
 Ross:Postpone it? Emily do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isn’t right.
 Ross:I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)
 Ross:The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.
 Ross:No. I’m saying it’s now. (He starts putting on his pants backwards again.)
 Ross:There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
 Ross:(chasing her trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No wait! Emily! No wait stop! Emily please—(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)
 Ross:Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
 Ross:Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
 Ross:Hey-hey since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady here’s a pickle what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:I don’t know I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
 Ross:Excuse me?
 Ross:I don’t know. A month?
 Ross:I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
 Ross:Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
 Ross:Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
 Ross:Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks and-and-and flowers and candles…
 Ross:But-but if you don’t love this we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really it’s fine whatever you want.
 Ross:And I don’t know if it starts to rain…
 Ross:(Ross hugs his mom and dad)Hi. Mom. Dad.
 Ross:what’s up Dad?
 Ross:(Holding him back.)Dad dad please. Look I don’t want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright shes had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (Picks up the bill.) Now here here let me go talk to him okay?
 Ross:Look face it my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
 Ross:I go back there with lawn ornaments he’s going to laugh in my face.
 Ross:Look were down to just one point. Could we please maybe just settle it after the wedding.
 Ross:(Screaming) I’m getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
 Ross:I’m getting married to..day!!
 Ross:Ahh whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.
 Ross:(Using a slightly different inflection for each.) I do. I do. I do.
 Ross:(Very Nervous)Really?
 Ross:Dad!! (Emily comes running in.)
 Ross:Nothing nothing. Everythings under control.
 Ross:(Stepping in between them.)Okay! Okay! That’s it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right this is our wedding day!   From now on everyone gets along and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! (Pointing at his mother.) That’s right!!
 Ross:(Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in her wedding dress.) My god. You...you look beautiful.
 Ross:You know what I think we’ve had all the bad luck we’re going to have. (He hugs her.)
 Ross:My God. Rachel! (He walks towards her grasps her hands and kisses her on the cheek.) Your here. I can’t believe it. (She giggles.) What happen? Why are you here?
 Ross:I Ross...
 Ross:Take thee Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.
 Ross:I Ross...
 Ross:Take thee Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.
 Ross:I Ross…
 Ross:Take thee (Glares at the Minister) Emily. (Chuckles) Like there’d be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)
 Ross:As my lawfully wedded wife in sickness and in health until death parts us. Really I do. Emily. (Points at her.)
 Ross:Happy too.
 Ross:Yay!
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:(laughs) That uh that was pretty funny. Wasn’t it?
 Ross:(exiting the bathroom) That-that-that’s all right no honey you take your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face to the gang) She’s just fixing her makeup.
 Ross:And I love you!! (He walks into the living room)
 Ross:That’s true thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey this is a party! Come on! Joey dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Oh no! It could be better but it’s gonna be okay right?
 Ross:No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean uh well I can understand why Emily would think it meant something y’know because-because it was you…
 Ross:But it absolutely didn’t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn’t!! It didn’t!!
 Ross:(sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh the band’s ready! Well I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!
 Ross:Look I’m sorry.
 Ross:Oh right!
 Ross:(Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone along with Emily.)
 Ross:(entering) Emily?!
 Ross:No I’ve looked everywhere!
 Ross:No! For all I know she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No from now on I’m staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.
 Ross:Actually do you guys mind staying here for a while?
 Ross:(disappointed) That’s cool.
 Ross:Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this y’know but you don’t have to rub my butt.
 Ross:Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)
 Ross:Wait well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
 Ross:Now hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look look your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah I said Rachel’s name but it didn’t mean anything Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all! (Rachel sits down depressed.) That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please promise me that you’ll tell her that.
 Ross:Rach! Rach!
 Ross:Hi! What are you what are you doing here?
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:Not yet.
 Ross:Pretty soon I guess.
 Ross:I just I don’t understand I mean how-how can she do this? Y’know what am I am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?

 Ross:Oh that is so great! Thats…
 Ross:So I asked Emily if she would come to New York and she said yes.
 Ross:No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
 Ross:I told her Id have to think about it. I mean how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (Theyre all quiet.) Im actually asking you!
 Ross:Thanks for the help problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)
 Ross:(entering) Okay thats it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult so Im just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and starts shaking a…)
 Ross:Well I dont know what else to do. I mean I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before Im 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion lets hear it! Cause I-I got nothing! All right dont be shy any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
 Ross:For what?
 Ross:Yeah I uh totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? Im waiting for a call from Emily.
 Ross:Its not that easy theres still a lot of relationship stuff.
 Ross:Just stuff. Yknow kinda what Emily wants.
 Ross:No. No. You-you cant help. I mean I kinda have to do this without your help.
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:(answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look umm yes Ive been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not knowing whats going on.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey.
 Ross:Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
 Ross:Damn!
 Ross:I told Emily to come. And I just need to yknow talk to Rachel about it.
 Ross:Well look Im just trying to focus on the I get to see my wife part all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig of Pepto Bismol.)
 Ross:I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
 Ross:So Rach yknow-yknow how Emilys coming right?
 Ross:Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this the last time I talked to Emily…
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Le Poos still alive?!
 Ross:Hey so uh yknow how theres something I wanted to talk to you about?
 Ross:Well yknow how Im trying to work things out with Emily. Well theres this one thing… Okay (Rachel has her back turned to the camera and Ross isnt looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachels nose)-Oh hey!
 Ross:Youre nose is bleeding!
 Ross:Umm… (Rachel blows her nose.)
 Ross:Okay I uh I cant see you anymore.
 Ross:Hey. Rachel I-I-Ive been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really I just have to get it out.
 Ross:Okay yknow how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
 Ross:And while that was good advice you should know that what-what she wants…
 Ross:…is for me not to see you anymore.
 Ross:Its awful I know I mean I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
 Ross:You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
 Ross:What are you doing?
 Ross:Rachel this is your apartment.
 Ross:You shouldve seen the look on her face. I dont want Rachel to hate me! I dont know what to do.
 Ross:Yes! Please!
 Ross:Thats okay.
 Ross:Thats not advice!
 Ross:Im going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)
 Ross:(entering) Pheebs you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:I talked to Monica look Im the one who made the choice. Im the one whos making things change so I should be the one to yknow step back.
 Ross:No no its okay. Really. Theyre plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is is that better?
 Ross:Well what-what would you do? Rach if you were me what-what would you do?
 Ross:I cant believe this is happening.
 Ross:I am so sorry.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:How come? Everybody else does.
 Ross:Oh umm Im just getting rid of a couple of things.
 Ross:Yes yes it is! No but its good its—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff thats just ours together. Yknow brand new.
 Ross:Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
 Ross:Look if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York Im sure everything will be fine.
 Ross:After what I did? Can you blame her?
 Ross:(on the phone) No-no-no its just a bit sudden. (Listens) No its great. Okay? Im totally on board. I love you too all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)
 Ross:Nothing. Oh actually great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like Im moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
 Ross:Well her thought is and I agree fresh new furniture why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet its got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
 Ross:Yes! Yes! I mean its-its kinda far from work but uh yknow Ill get so much done on the commute. I-Ive been given the gift of time!
 Ross:(on phone) I know I miss you too. I cant wait to see you. I love you. Bye. (Hangs up.)
 Ross:No-no this is my collection of fossil samples.
 Ross:Im really gonna miss this apartment. Yknow Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. (Points.)
 Ross:I loved this place! To tell you the truth I wish I didnt have to move.
 Ross:Well I mean if uh if Emily gave me a choice…
 Ross:Why?
 Ross:Whats going on?
 Ross:Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right its about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because its not all laughing happy candy in the sky drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! Its real life okay? Its what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)
 Ross:Yep.
 Ross:Yknow what? Im really not in the mood.
 Ross:Look this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
 Ross:Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
 Ross:You do huh?
 Ross:What are you talking about?
 Ross:Wait! Wait! Wait! Yknow what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
 Ross:Hey! Hey look! Ugly Naked Guys back!
 Ross:Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah were just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh yeah sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.
 Ross:Yknow what? Uh Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)
 Ross:Yeah yeah shes here.
 Ross:(on phone) Hi.
 Ross:(going onto the patio) Look Emily Im just having dinner with my friends okay?
 Ross:Emily thats ridiculous. Look Im-Im moving for you Im cutting friends out of my life for you. Please just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay youll see youre the only person I want to be with.
 Ross:Well you cant know where I am all the time. Look this marriage is never gonna work if you dont trust me.
 Ross:So can you trust me?
 Ross:Well I guess thats it.
 Ross:My marriage is over.
 Ross:Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
 Ross:Emilys cousin kicked me out!
 Ross:Well when youre subletting an apartment from your wifes cousin and then you get a divorce sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
 Ross:Who needs a lease when its family!
 Ross:You got it.
 Ross:Thanks you guys I really appreciate this. All right Im gonna get packing again. Man Ive been moving around so much Im beginning to feel like a nomad.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
 Ross:Oh yeah I know I know its a lot of boxes but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
 Ross:Oh I uh hope you dont mind I kinda uh jazzed it up a little. Check this out. (He plays the greeting and We Will Rock You starts to play and Rosss voice comes over it.) We will we will call you back!
 Ross:Pretty cool huh?
 Ross:(glaring at him) Joey please! (Motions to his computer.)
 Ross:(entering) Uh fellas (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
 Ross:Ill take sports.
 Ross:All right. Uhh international.
 Ross:Well I guess I can check out those apartment listings even though theres never anything in here.
 Ross:(looks) Oh yeah! Youre—hey youre right! Heres an affordable place (reading ad) two bedroom close to work ooh its available in five weeks!

 Ross:Okay lets go.
 Ross:Oh-oh-ooh hey guys I was wondering if you guys would uh maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all we all are using it.
 Ross:Oh my God! (Looking around which doesnt take him long.)
 Ross:I think this is it. I dont know maybe we should keep looking.
 Ross:(To Joey) So you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
 Ross:(To Chandler) How about you?
 Ross:All right I see what you guys are saying. Ill uh Ill go downstairs and fill out an application.
 Ross:Hey. So I uh I didnt get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
 Ross:Yeah. But the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So…
 Ross:Look you guys dont need me here taking up your space.
 Ross:Are you guys sure about this?
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:So Im a pimp huh? Its okay! Look I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the quiet down maneuver).
 Ross:(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on its fun!
 Ross:I couldnt possibly eat another bite.
 Ross:Huh I dont know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
 Ross:Im sorry. Its just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
 Ross:Oh God no.
 Ross:Youre right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
 Ross:In this life Phoebe.
 Ross:Yeah thats the same.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Uh everyone this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
 Ross:Oh this is Monica.
 Ross:Oh mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesnt eat any Thanksgiving food.
 Ross:So uh Rach? Does it does it feel weird around here now? Yknow since Ive been away at college.
 Ross:Well thats cool. So did… (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)
 Ross:Umm Im sorry Judy I couldnt find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.

 Ross:So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Yknow maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Listen Roland Chang if things go well I’m gonna be out with her all night.

 Ross:So uh wheres Monica?
 Ross:Dude!
 Ross:Oh mom! Okay umm her name is Carol. And shes really pretty. And smart. And uh shes-shes on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!

 Ross:(Proudly) Yeah.
 Ross:Oh no you-you dont understand. Ugh this is so silly. Umm this is all because of a sandwich.
 Ross:Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is she puts a an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…
 Ross:What?
 Ross:You ate my sandwich?
 Ross:(getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
 Ross:Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
 Ross:(getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!
 Ross:(jumping to his feet in anger) What?
 Ross:You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
 Ross:(losing control we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
 Ross:MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Rosss scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
 Ross:(in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
 Ross:Im fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
 Ross:On account of my rage.
 Ross:He gave me a pill for it.
 Ross:Uh-huh. Well when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so I took it.
 Ross:I dont know. Its going to be weird not having a job for a while but I I definitely dont care about my sandwich.
 Ross:(entering with the rest of the gang) Whats going on?
 Ross:(covering his eyes) Dude! Thats my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)
 Ross:Yeah whats going on?
 Ross:You slept with my sister?
 Ross:This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)
 Ross:My God Monica!!
 Ross:Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joeys underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
 Ross:I...reorganized the fridge. See bottom shelf meats and dairy. (There’s nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf fruits and vegetables. (There’s one lone tomato.) And top shelf expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)
 Ross:Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank post office and the dry cleaners.
 Ross:Hey I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!
 Ross:So what we just sit?
 Ross:Im sorry man. Hey yknow what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Yknow like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
 Ross:Or that.
 Ross:Ill help you. Yeah Ill make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus itll give me something to do.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:(grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right well start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
 Ross:And it cant be Joey.
 Ross:Or Joseph.
 Ross:All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters he looks suspicious. (Stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) Thats it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey youre supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! (Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is and what is all this?! (Reading.) The official rulebook of Fireball.
 Ross:This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
 Ross:(To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better Joey needs to work. (To Joey) Now come on!
 Ross:No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! (After Joey walks past Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)
 Ross:So Pheebs are you gonna go back out there or what?
 Ross:Oh-oh yeah.
 Ross:Uh you weighted 200 pounds.
 Ross:Yeah not since I got too strong for you.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Oh fine.
 Ross:Joeys not going.
 Ross:Because tomorrow hes redoing yesterdays pages.
 Ross:I think hes been relaxing enough thanks to you and Fireball.
 Ross:I am not unemployed. Im on sabbatical!
 Ross:And the reason Im doing this is because I am Joeys friend. And if you were a good friend youd be doing the same thing.
 Ross:If it does? Then youre an amazing friend of mine.
 Ross:How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now no ones going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
 Ross:No you didnt. You said you would but you never did!
 Ross:Hey if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
 Ross:Yay!
 Ross:I guess when you dont have so many distractions its easier for you to focus. Huh?
 Ross:All right. (Takes another copy.)
 Ross:Hey man.
 Ross:About yesterday I was really wrong. I am sorry.
 Ross:Maybe it was both of us but we had our best friends interest… (Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friends interest at heart.
 Ross:I dont know Im one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right Joey we get it. (To Chandler) Im sorry.
 Ross:(reading from the script.) I am sorry Chandler.
 Ross:(hopping) 73! 72! 71!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Well whos gonna kiss my sister.
 Ross:Awww man! Really?
 Ross:Thats a good point.
 Ross:Oh well since I have that whole history with Rachel I guess Phoebe.
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:Well everyones gotta kiss someone. You cant kiss Ross you got the history.

 Ross:Yknow what? Im gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in 99!
 Ross:Just the one divorce in 99! Yknow what I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
 Ross:Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I havent done before. That my friends is my New Years resolution.

 Ross:What are you what are you doing?
 Ross:What to blind my child?
 Ross:(talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (Hes still wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? Its like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot?
 Ross:Okay it must just be me then.
 Ross:That was just the pants on the couch. Umm hey do you do you mind if I use your bathroom?
 Ross:Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so the sound returns. Without another word he heads into her bathroom.)

 Ross:(calling from Elizabeths bathroom) Joey its Ross! I need some help!
 Ross:Well you can help me!
 Ross:Listen Im in Elizabeths bathroom…
 Ross:No I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look I-I cant put them back on. I cant!
 Ross:Powder! Yeah! Yeah I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.)
 Ross:Yeah okay hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It doesnt work and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.) Theyre not coming on man.
 Ross:Ohh I-I see lotion I have lotion! Will that work?
 Ross:Hold on.
 Ross:Theyre still theyre still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
 Ross:What difference does that make?!
 Ross:Dude what am I gonna…

 Ross:I had a problem.
 Ross:This year was supposed to be great! But its only the second day and Im a loser with stupid leather pants that dont even fit!
 Ross:Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
 Ross:Oh be-because of the leather pants.
 Ross:Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh yknow they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) Im gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monicas bedroom.) I cant believe he thinks Im a cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monicas room.)
 Ross:(disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh by-the-by its my ex-wife Emily!
 Ross:Oh thanks Gunther. (He takes it hands the plate its on to Rachel sets it down on the table and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
 Ross:(entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs whats going on?
 Ross:No! No! No!
 Ross:I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now its all covered in-in… (The duck quacks.) Actually thanks!
 Ross:Uh actually I think Im gonna skip it.
 Ross:Yeah Im gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
 Ross:Thats okay Joe.

 Ross:Just yknow out.
 Ross:I uh went to a bar. And then I just uh just walked around for a while.
 Ross:Look I dont have to answer your questions! Okay? Im a big boy I can do whatever I want!

 Ross:Okay I didnt know you would say that.
 Ross:Look I didnt lose my mind! Okay Janice and I have a lot in common! Weve-weve both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
 Ross:I am gonna see her again.
 Ross:(entering) Hey guys!
 Ross:Yknow what? It sounds so weird to say this but I just had a great day with Janice!
 Ross:Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff thats been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
 Ross:Thanks!
 Ross:Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how Im on sabbatical from work right?
 Ross:Oh…
 Ross:This isnt what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…
 Ross:Okay. Sometimes I feel…
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:Let-let me make sure Im hearing this right youre ending this with me because Im too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So youre saying Ive become so whiney that I annoy you Janice.
 Ross:OH…MY…GOD!!
 Ross:I am now.
 Ross:Dude we got to talk.
 Ross:I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isnt too weird but uh I had uh a thing with Janice. (He laughs his real laugh this time.) What youre-youre not mad?
 Ross:Well because yknow there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You dont uh you dont fool around with your uh friends ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls theyre related to.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:(walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.
 Ross:Sorry.
 Ross:(glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.
 Ross:Hey Pheebs hows it going?
 Ross:Is everything okay?
 Ross:Uhh Pheebs Grandmother just died.
 Ross:Your make-up!
 Ross:Whats the part Anti-man?
 Ross:Hey how are you holding up?
 Ross:What happened?
 Ross:Wh-what did he say?!
 Ross:Well but arent you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me this guy would be in some serious physical danger! (Getting worked up) I mean I-I-Id walk in there and Id be like Yo dad! You and me outside right now! (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.
 Ross:Well maybe he just didnt want to hurt your feelings.
 Ross:What kind of problem?
 Ross:Nooooo!
 Ross:Ironically most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
 Ross:Hey! Hey! If hes moving maybe I should try to get his place!
 Ross:It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
 Ross:Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isnt it perfect?! I cant believe I never realized how great it is!
 Ross:(laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)
 Ross:(entering) Whats going on?
 Ross:What?! What?!
 Ross:Actually it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Well I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and hes already had like a hundred applicants.
 Ross:No-no I got the edge. I know its not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
 Ross:No.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:A basket of mini-muffins.
 Ross:The small one.
 Ross:Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
 Ross:Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! Theres twelve bucks Ill never see again! (Exits.)
 Ross:Noooo.
 Ross:Look Ive already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because weve been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh lets see now he had the trampoline.
 Ross:Well he had gravity boots.
 Ross:Okay Ive got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He opens the door and stops.) Hey didnt he used to have a cat?
 Ross:Right. (Exits.)
 Ross:Good evening sir. My name is Ross Geller. Im one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—Im sorry. I I cant help but notice youre naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you. Man I wish I was naked. I mean this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
 Ross:A new place for a new Ross. Im gonna have you and all the guys from work over once its yknow furnished.
 Ross:Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.

 Ross:What the hell are doing?!!
 Ross:(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!

 Ross:What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the door.) You all knew and you didnt tell me?!!
 Ross:(happily again) You were worried about me? You didnt know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)
 Ross:Hey you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…
 Ross:You cant just call Godfather. Dont you think her brother should be Godfather?

For everyone in the building and Im gonna sit them down and explain to them I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! Im just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.

 Ross:Oh theyll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
 Ross:Oh no!
 Ross:Well unless you make some kind of big gesture.

 Ross:What are you doing?
 Ross:You chipped in?!
 Ross:Phoebe! I cant believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
 Ross:Yeah but youre making me look bad!

 Ross:Rach thanks but uh I dont need you doing me any favors.
 Ross:Well that I can believe.
 Ross:(To Phoebe) And shes supposed to buy this?!
 Ross:Hm-mmm.
 Ross:(sits down at the table) Oh eh just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. (Joey panics.)
 Ross:(turning and looking) What? Where?
 Ross:What am I looking at?
 Ross:Me too!
 Ross:Ross has the blender! Ugh everythings just falling apart!
 Ross:(to Gary) That was so cool man the way you leaned on that guy.
 Ross:(to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
 Ross:Oh hey Gary want me to grab the berry for ya?
 Ross:Its the—Chandler!!
 Ross:So where are we going next?
 Ross:Yeah no one talks like that!
 Ross:Hey Im more cop than you two!
 Ross:Hello! Im in the front seat okay? Im Garys partner!
 Ross:Umm jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)
 Ross:Yeah no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)
 Ross:Sorry! Sorry! Oh (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (Its just there flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary who am I? Phone home!
 Ross:What is it?
 Ross:What? What? What? What is it?
 Ross:Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
 Ross:(on the machine) Hey Ross! Its you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself okay? Okay. Oh and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)
 Ross:Pheebs we had the most incredible night! Okay so were in the car…
 Ross:Okay okay so were in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
 Ross:Yeah but-but he didnt know that!
 Ross:And it couldve just as easily have been a bullet.
 Ross:Wow! I couldve died tonight.
 Ross:I do have a newfound respect for life.
 Ross:Rach what uh what are you doing here?
 Ross:Yknow it-it doesnt matter. The important thing is that youre here. Youre my friend and youre here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)
 Ross:The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
 Ross:Okay okay we were on the ride along with Gary right?
 Ross:And somebody took a shot at me!
 Ross:No a car backfired but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Yknow? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
 Ross:(stares at her briefly) Okay why are you here?
 Ross:You talked to her?
 Ross:Well okay what-what did she say?
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Huh? Yeah! Yes of course!
 Ross:Right. I guess I guess I should call Emily.
 Ross:Okay look yesterday I wouldve even considered calling her back but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean that-that has got to mean something!
 Ross:You werent there! Okay maybe this is something that I-Im supposed to seize! Yknow?
 Ross:Huh.
 Ross:That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity but I-I really dont wanna see or talk to her.
 Ross:Yeah. Maybe today is just close call day.
 Ross:Hey thanks Rach. (They hug.)
 Ross:Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didnt erase it.
 Ross:(on machine) Hey Ross its you! (Hits the stop button) Oh yeah no thats-thats an old message nobody needs to hear that.
 Ross:(looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm was-was Monica here?
 Ross:Yeah I want my money back.
 Ross:Hey Pheebs has Gary ever been shot at for real?
 Ross:I wonder how I would react under fire yknow? And not backfire but-but heavy fire like I was in a war or something.
 Ross:I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
 Ross:Uh-huh thats why they call it Staten Island.
 Ross:(he catches the ball and pauses staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an island.
 Ross:(looks at his watch) 217.
 Ross:Are you serious?!
 Ross:Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
 Ross:You bought Shawn Cassidy!
 Ross:What-what is it?!
 Ross:Why is it inside out?!
 Ross:How much did you pay for that?
 Ross:Yeah? How much?
 Ross:ON A CAT??!!!!
 Ross:Free cats do that too yknow. {Which reminds me if I might get a little political here support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from you get a much better deal from the shelter plus they probably wont die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash go to the shelter and save its life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
 Ross:(To Joey) Hey you wanna get something to eat or uh do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Uhh yeah it would! Lets do it!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Dont switch hands okay?
 Ross:…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
 Ross:How do you know? You dont have a watch.
 Ross:Monica whatever you do do not drop that ball!
 Ross:2 hours 27 minutes.
 Ross:Hey Rach!
 Ross:Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin it!
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Doesnt sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
 Ross:(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! Were on the same team!
 Ross:Its really a uh-uh three person game yknow?
 Ross:All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
 Ross:Baking it didnt help huh?
 Ross:Im starving!
 Ross:Im still hungry!
 Ross:I am!
 Ross:Oh thank God!
 Ross:I know. My arm is killing me.
 Ross:Whats going on?
 Ross:Oh God here we go!
 Ross:Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone elses she like freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
 Ross:Hey does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes his eye)
 Ross:All right I gotta go. Im taking Ben to the park.

 Ross:What do you like better flora or fauna?
 Ross:Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
 Ross:Why are you mad at me?
 Ross:When did I say you were boring?!
 Ross:Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
 Ross:Hey Rach can you pass me the TV Guide?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh but Ive got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! Ive been waiting like a year for this.
 Ross:Whatd you say?
 Ross:Is that supposed to be an insult?
 Ross:So Rach maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
 Ross:Yeah? All right Ill call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)
 Ross:(in his head) Oh my God! Thats Rachel naked! I cant look at that! I am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay vivid colors expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows Im home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someones lonely tonight. Oh-ho Dr. Geller! Stop it! Youre being silly! Or am I?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:May I come in?
 Ross:Do you want me too?
 Ross:So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach before anything happens (He takes off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.) This is just about tonight. I dont to go through with this if its going to raise the question of Us. (Rachels confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)
 Ross:The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)
 Ross:Oh so-so you werent trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
 Ross:You werent trying to entice me with your nakedness.
 Ross:No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other one and heads for the door.)
 Ross:Can we can we just forget this ever happened?
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:All right I guess Im gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)
 Ross:(sarcastic) Yep! Thats hilarious!
 Ross:Yknow last night was embarrassing for you too.
 Ross:Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
 Ross:What?! You totally get embarrassed!
 Ross:Is that so?
 Ross:(loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I dont care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
 Ross:(to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Yknow that teacher who had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)
 Ross:What the? What…
 Ross:Ohh it was the best!
 Ross:I think the check in is that way. (Points)
 Ross:Phoebe! (They hug.)
 Ross:Hey you wet my pants!
 Ross:Rach! Wait! The mens room is that way. (Points in the other direction. Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oooohhh Ill bet shes one of those people.
 Ross:What? No-no a lurker.
 Ross:Okay when youre playing a machine and it hasnt paid out a lurker waits for you to give up and then…
 Ross:No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
 Ross:Uh-hmm.
 Ross:My nana used to do it. Thats how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.
 Ross:Yes its a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop then does a little dance-type sway.)
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Oh my God! Rach-Rach are-are-are you sure?
 Ross:Joey!!
 Ross:(To Joey) Thanks man.
 Ross:Hey listen I uh talked to Chandler sorry about the movie.

 Ross:Umm he said he thought I was funny. So…(Rachel stares at him.) Okay look-look umm lets just go downstairs well have some fun and you will forget all about it.
 Ross:Oh come on! Rach its-its not that bad.
 Ross:Look just because some idiot drew on your face doesnt mean you shouldnt have any fun! Okay? And besides hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) There are tons…of…freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice I swear!
 Ross:Okay there was some staring and pointing.
 Ross:Oh hey yknow they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because its all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is one big drink!
 Ross:(looking at the price list) Umm… Wow! Thats-thats some pricey nut!
 Ross:Really like those Macadamia nuts huh?
 Ross:(gets up) All right. Yknow what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right come on come on well play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.
 Ross:(does so) Oohh 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)
 Ross:Youre right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)
 Ross:(runs out of cards) We need more cards.
 Ross:That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.)
 Ross:Ohh its Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)
 Ross:Ill do it. Hey whatever you need me to do Im your man. (He starts to sit down on the bed. Theres one problem though hes about two feet to the left of it. Needless to say he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you are you okay?
 Ross:Ohh heres that Macadamia nut!
 Ross:(he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the bed.)
 Ross:I wanna get out of the room! Yknow I…I really miss downstairs.
 Ross:Well hello! Im Ross!
 Ross:Excuse me sir youve got a little something right here. (He points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
 Ross:(bowing) Hello!
 Ross:Well hello Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
 Ross:Well hello Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
 Ross:Why are we in bed together?
 Ross:(checks) Yeah.
 Ross:No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh did we? I mean I don’t remember much about last night it was such a blur.
 Ross:And we didn’t have sex.
 Ross:(getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has Just Married written on his back.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
 Ross:We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
 Ross:I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
 Ross:Laugh it up but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:No-no that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah actually um I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
 Ross:I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
 Ross:Yes exactly!
 Ross:Wow! This is so amazing. I uh I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.
 Ross:I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
 Ross:Okay look how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!
 Ross:I’m asking you to do me a favor.
 Ross:And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Listen I know you wanted to talk to me but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register and you get to keep all the presents!
 Ross:I don’t know if it’s true.
 Ross:Oh okay y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
 Ross:All right. All right I’ll do it.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh yeah no problems. It’s all taken care of.
 Ross:Oh yeah why not?
 Ross:Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh you wanna hear something weird?
 Ross:I didn’t get the annulment.
 Ross:We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh yeah no problems. It’s all taken care of.
 Ross:Oh yeah why not?
 Ross:Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh you wanna hear something weird?
 Ross:I didn’t get the annulment.
 Ross:We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey do you have any gum?
 Ross:I know.
 Ross:Well I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was Three divorces. Three divorces! Look I just don’t want my tombstone to read Ross Gellar Three Divorces.
 Ross:Look all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!
 Ross:Well okay so I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel please?
 Ross:Hey! Hi!
 Ross:What’s up?
 Ross:Oh my God. Ohh my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh that’s great. That’s great. (Kisses and hugs her.)
 Ross:Bye.
 Ross:Could ya just could ya just lay off please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!
 Ross:(interrupting) No! No I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh Murderer Guy and-and Geologists.
 Ross:Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
 Ross:What?! Why?
 Ross:And if you wait right here I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
 Ross:…once you know the stories it’s not that bad. First marriage wife’s hidden sexuality not my fault. Second marriage said the wrong name at the altar a little my fault. Third marriage well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face Nevada’s fault.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:This is crazy! I mean yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past but now she is just my wife! Phoebe will you-will you help me out here?
 Ross:We were drunk! I would’ve married uh Joey with that amount of alcohol!
 Ross:(to the panel) Look I’m sorry but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.
 Ross:(getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leans down to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!
 Ross:Yes.
 Ross:Yes second in two years. Third overall.
 Ross:Basically Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…
 Ross:Yes-yes-yes! But I-I do not love her.
 Ross:This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
 Ross:I think just the annulment for today.
 Ross:Easy.
 Ross:No problem.
 Ross:Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh it was it was already taken care of.
 Ross:Uh-ha what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.
 Ross:Oh no.
 Ross:I couldn’t.
 Ross:It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…
 Ross:I… I do I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
 Ross:I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
 Ross:Ohh what’s wrong?!
 Ross:Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.
 Ross:Of course.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh that. Umm she took it really well.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her as a friend.
 Ross:It’s nothing I just gave her a hug.
 Ross:It’s also a sign of friendship.
 Ross:(grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
 Ross:S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
 Ross:I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoebe raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
 Ross:(grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in love then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Rach uh you still looking for a place?
 Ross:Okay there’s this guy Warren from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh you interested?
 Ross:Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number.
 Ross:Okay you go grab it!
 Ross:I don’t know what you’re talking about.
 Ross:Look I do not re-love her.
 Ross:Look we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
 Ross:You can live with me.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
 Ross:Well I’m-I’m just glad I could y’know help you out.
 Ross:Hero I uh I don’t know—well all right.
 Ross:Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You’re gonna say things now aren’t ya?
 Ross:Hey! Oh listen I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
 Ross:What do you mean they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?
 Ross:What?! Over a stupid room!
 Ross:Oh no yeah no that part’s great!
 Ross:What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean that is so silly!
 Ross:Well apparently not and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean enough of the silliness!
 Ross:(stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points look I’ve known you both a long time and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important love or silliness?
 Ross:Okay! All right! Now Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica right?
 Ross:And Mon you wanna live with Chandler don’t ya?
 Ross:(jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! (Storms out.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey Rach!
 Ross:You’re never gonna believe it uh Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?
 Ross:Yeah but on the bright side we get to be roommates again.
 Ross:Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it why would it be weird?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place I mean are you still in that place?
 Ross:Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.
 Ross:Really?! We are?
 Ross:Ohh! That would be great.
 Ross:(laughs as well but for a different reason) Yeah I didn’t think of that.
 Ross:So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!
 Ross:No I-I-I’m serious okay? I mean think about it. You move in you start fighting over stupid game rooms next thing y’know you break up!
 Ross:Okay there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately this room (Points to Rachel’s room) could destroy you!!
 Ross:Fine! It’s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister but stops and tries one last time.) I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that’s what you want there’s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON’T DO IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
 Ross:(To Rachel) So umm where are the other guys?
 Ross:Fighting?!
 Ross:Yeah. There’s no breaking them up is there?
 Ross:Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
 Ross:Yeah I’m-I’m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah get out of here before I change my mind. (She exits)
 Ross:I’ve been back and forth.
 Ross:Ehh I don’t I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know dating other guys.
 Ross:Yeah well m-maybe you’re right.
 Ross:Is that what I want?
 Ross:Whoa! Whoa! Whoa Joey!
 Ross:How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh in a way you-you complete me (Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
 Ross:(in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen matey!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
 Ross:Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always Ross what are you gonna do about Rachel? Ross why-why are you moving in with Rachel? When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel? You want her!
 Ross:(answering it) Uh-oh saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?
 Ross:(on phone) No-no-no that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh Y uh U!
 Ross:Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate huh? They loved it.
 Ross:I know! Anyway they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary but uh if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox huh? Professor Geller.
 Ross:(entering) Hey everyone!
 Ross:Hey uh well today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys do you do you mind?
 Ross:(he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…
 Ross:(continuing) …subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…
 Ross:No! Why?
 Ross:Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler) into…
 Ross:Open with a joke? It’s a university not a comedy club!
 Ross:(gets up) Okay!
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:Please don’t say naked chicks.
 Ross:I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
 Ross:(entering) Hello!
 Ross:It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!
 Ross:I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all Ross you have to be funny and sexy. Well I proved them wrong! And now I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
 Ross:That’s right!
 Ross:(to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.
 Ross:Look I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
 Ross:Will you-will you please?
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:(in his British accent) I’m sorry I’ve got plans with my sister.
 Ross:(in accent) Right will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
 Ross:Just please stop!
 Ross:(entering) Look I really need some help okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
 Ross:They’re not listening too me?
 Ross:Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
 Ross:(in his head) All right keep going. We are phasing the accent out phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
 Ross:(British) Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh just came out. I’m sorry. So if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…
 Ross:(in the accent again) Well hello Rachel!
 Ross:Look I was going to tell you!
 Ross:Okay maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.
 Ross:Rach come on if you think about it it’s actually kinda funny. (He laughs and he laughs alone.) Okay maybe it’s best not to think about it.
 Ross:Phoebe I told her you already knew.
 Ross:Okay I got us a court date for tomorrow at 200 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.
 Ross:Okay Rach but…
 Ross:Look I told you…
 Ross:Look if you’d had two failed marriages you’d understand!
 Ross:What about the time I said we were on a break?
 Ross:Fine I’m mentally unstable.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!
 Ross:Oh come on!
 Ross:Okay I’m sorry this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin I’m not gay and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look I’ll consummate this marriage right here right now!
 Ross:And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
 Ross:(stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny funny form!
 Ross:And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He’s still typing.) Stop typing! Stop typing!!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:My fault?! You threatened the judge!
 Ross:That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
 Ross:The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)
 Ross:I picked up the divorce papers. Uh I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.
 Ross:Y’know I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
 Ross:Okay how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
 Ross:Yeah! Right!
 Ross:You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s let’s just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?
 Ross:Okay can we just sign please?
 Ross:Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Excuse me?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:So then if-if—I mean if you think about it this is all (Pause.) your fault.
 Ross:I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women never thought I would be divorcing you.
 Ross:Did I did I even treat?
 Ross:That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.
 Ross:Eh no problem.
 Ross:Totally. (Exits.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Whoa-whoa-whoa Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
 Ross:I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
 Ross:Oh but-but I can’t do it.
 Ross:Because because I’ve got Ben.
 Ross:Of course he is! What do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
 Ross:(to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.
 Ross:Oh I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.
 Ross:Ben say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay talk to you later.
 Ross:(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon how’s the packing going? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.
 Ross:And now you want that money back.
 Ross:Chandler what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)
 Ross:I’m sorry you lost your money but I won it fair and square.
 Ross:Now if you wanna try to make some of it back I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you I am very good at Cups.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:So I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030 therell be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
 Ross:Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
 Ross:So uh wha-uh what do you do?
 Ross:Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
 Ross:Yeah yeah man dont do it. I mean if you date her then-then-then I cant date her.
 Ross:Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:(enters) Wow couples who live together do start to look alike. So Mondler...uh what uh what ‘cha doin?
 Ross:Did you get Monicas authorization to move all of her stuff?
 Ross:Put it back exactly where you found it?
 Ross:‘Kay first of all this attitude is not helping.
 Ross:Whoa hello did you just meet Monica?
 Ross:Hmm -you know actually thisll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey Joeys hot new roommate can come and live with me.
 Ross:Look Chandler Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God shes going to sit on you.
 Ross:Yeah the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.) And that goes back up there.
 Ross:Yeah that-that doesnt look right.
 Ross:Whoa whoa but then the back of the couch wont line up with he back of the carpet.
 Ross:Whoa Whoa Whoa but then the coffee table wont be centered in the seating area.
 Ross:Hey Ive been married 3 times
 Ross:Look we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
 Ross:Yeah well what about you? You werent you know so hot in college either. After everything he said hed go ba dum bum chessh
 Ross:Oh yknow what girls dont like it when I start talking about science.
 Ross:Uh they dont like it when you correct their grammar.
 Ross:They dont like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
 Ross:(nonchalantly) Im never gonna find love again.
 Ross:Who cares? I repel women.
 Ross:(whispers) What?!
 Ross:Why does anyone have to be naked?
 Ross:I-I had to show Chandler something?
 Ross:Yeah-yeah I uh I have a uh a guy problem.

 Ross:So really whatd ya have?
 Ross:Bye! (Runs out)
 Ross:So it said that by the year 2030 therell be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
 Ross:Thats so Janine you-you-you know what do you know were doing right now? You and I were interfacing.
 Ross:Well is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
 Ross:The one that always stares at me when I come in?
 Ross:Still I could tell. She was into me. (Joey rolls his eyes.) Well why don’t you set us up?
 Ross:Maybe it’s a universal thing?
 Ross:Hey guys.
 Ross:What’s up? (He smiles. His teeth are freakishly white.)
 Ross:I whitened them.
 Ross:Yeah. What do you think.
 Ross:Come on seriously.
 Ross:Ahh I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
 Ross:A-A day.
 Ross:I know. That’s why I did it. (With a big smile) Come on are they really that bad?
 Ross:Oh hey hey Rach do you notice anything..ahh…
 Ross:I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
 Ross:Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
 Ross:Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.
 Ross:But won’t she notice I have makeup on?
 Ross:What??
 Ross:No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)
 Ross:Mmm-Hmm.
 Ross:Mmm.
 Ross:Mm-Hmm.
 Ross:(Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.
 Ross:Mmm-Unmm.
 Ross:Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I uh am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um I um have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But but let’s talk more about you. Hmm.
 Ross:Mmm.
 Ross:(Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.) Me neither. I’ve had a really good time too you know. (Putting the bread down.)
 Ross:(Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh I just like the smell. (Sniffing it.) Mmmm.
 Ross:Hmm-Hmm.
 Ross:Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)
 Ross:(Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.
 Ross:(Looking at the posters.) Wow cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? (They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So ahh where were we?
 Ross:Ohh you can see them huh?
 Ross:I-I did that for you.
 Ross:What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!
 Ross:(only half-paying attention) Yes of course they like you!
 Ross:(not paying attention) Yeah they don’t like you.
 Ross:I dunno maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-
 Ross:(trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don’t want to play video games Joey!
 Ross:For real?
 Ross:Yeah see we-we-we have to stop across the hall because it’s my sister. But uh uh y’know actually growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah you-you should tell your friends that.
 Ross:And the place looks so nice!
 Ross:Happy Thanksgiving!
 Ross:See ya!
 Ross:Oh oh we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.
 Ross:Some would say she’s attractive yes.
 Ross:(to Joey) Dude we were good!
 Ross:Oh but-but it is uh it’s just like the first Thanksgiving when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh sat down to dinner.
 Ross:Yeah yeah what is it?
 Ross:W-What was the one right before bananas?
 Ross:Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no there is no way!
 Ross:Oh my God the pages are stuck together!
 Ross:Oh My God she-she made half a English Trifle and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!
 Ross:No no we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.
 Ross:Yeah it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
 Ross:(worried) Dude I need to talk to you a sec.
 Ross:Okay I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.
 Ross:Okay remember we were young. Hey Spring break sophomore year I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
 Ross:I don’t know aheh your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.
 Ross:How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
 Ross:I don’t know I-I was all high.
 Ross:Okay okay I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
 Ross:Alright alright now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
 Ross:Okay fine!
 Ross:Oh uh can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
 Ross:What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving not...Truth-Day!
 Ross:Okay okay we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! (Referring to the dancers.)
 Ross:Hey Rach can I talk to you outside for a second?
 Ross:So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us hm?
 Ross:And um...You look nice today.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(shocked) Eh?
 Ross:(cutting her off) You’re alone.
 Ross:(just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well can’t blame a guy for trying!
 Ross:Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like he’s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
 Ross:It tastes like feet!
 Ross:Are you kidding?
 Ross:Oh yeah about telling Mom and Dad I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
 Ross:Wha-what?
 Ross:(in a 5 year old’s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom Dad you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
 Ross:Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.
 Ross:Yeah well Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing Monica did!
 Ross:Monica and Chandler are living together!
 Ross:I-I uh I got tricked into all those things!
 Ross:Hey
 Ross:Wow Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
 Ross:… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
 Ross:I am so over Janine. I mean yeah at first I thought she was hot but now she’s like OLD NEWS!
 Ross:Hi Janine!
 Ross:You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
 Ross:Oh well you see how it works is the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah not a lot of people know that.
 Ross:Are you serious?
 Ross:Bye Janine!
 Ross:It was a dry day.
 Ross:Oh my God!
 Ross:Got it!
 Ross:Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!
 Ross:Yeah I have a question. When is this gonna air?
 Ross:Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
 Ross:Why do they keep doing that?
 Ross:Right.
 Ross:Hey what’d you guys do to get up on there?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:We know!
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Monica! (Pause) Would it?
 Ross:Hey I know what’ll get us up on a platform!
 Ross:The routine!
 Ross:Hey when the snippy guy sees the routine he’ll wanna build us our own platform!
 Ross:We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look it’s almost fake midnight do we really have any other choice?
 Ross:So do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?
 Ross:Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Hey when the music starts up again I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot y’know? (He mimics a robot)
 Ross:I don’t know I mean you were a lot bigger I mean stronger back then.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You kissed her.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You like it?
 Ross:It’s my new apothecary table!
 Ross:Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
 Ross:Why did you do that?
 Ross:She hates Pottery Barn?!!
 Ross:What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)
 Ross:Uh yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!
 Ross:Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.
 Ross:Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
 Ross:Hey Pheebs could you please not put your feet up on my new…(On Rachel’s glare)…old sheet?
 Ross:My apothecary table!!!
 Ross:I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
 Ross:Of course not it smells like wine which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
 Ross:Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
 Ross:A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
 Ross:(glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.
 Ross:Hmm a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)
 Ross:Really?! (To Rachel) Hey y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need uh ooh here’s-here’s 60 bucks why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
 Ross:She does want to.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Y’know what would cheer you up?
 Ross:I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night I think you should come.
 Ross:Hey you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
 Ross:Yeah they print jokes interviews hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.
 Ross:(showing them the page) Here check it out. It’s the first one too.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Uh oh-oh no you didn’t. I did.
 Ross:Hey tell Dan ‘Thanks.’
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Look Chandler it’s my joke. But hey if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit right?
 Ross:No it’s my joke it’s mine. You can call them they’ll tell you.
 Ross:It’s my joke.
 Ross:You know Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
 Ross:What you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.
 Ross:Your joke? Well I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
 Ross:Well I was going to stick it in the ATM but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
 Ross:Oh what are you going to do follow me down there?
 Ross:Well I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
 Ross:(showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh hey Gunther check this out.
 Ross:Uh yeah I’ll take a coffee. Thanks man.
 Ross:Yeah why would it be weird? Hey Joey can I get some coffee?
 Ross:Seriously I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.
 Ross:Joey seriously can I get my coffee?
 Ross:It’s my joke.
 Ross:Y’know I don’t think we’re going to settle this.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Hey Mon.
 Ross:Monica! (She appears not sure why she was summoned.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Yeah but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.
 Ross:We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.
 Ross:See I would never snap at you like that.
 Ross:Are you kidding? Okay look. I-I studied evolution. Remember evolution? Monkey into man? Plus I’m a doctor and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!
 Ross:It’s your joke.
 Ross:No way.
 Ross:Hey Joey how come our stuff isn’t free?
 Ross:Hey does anyone have any gum?
 Ross:Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.
 Ross:Hi Jill.
 Ross:Jill how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
 Ross:I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
 Ross:Sorry-sorry Jill.
 Ross:Huh? Oh I got this—(Holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!
 Ross:Yeah! Oh I-I love this babies!
 Ross:Ross wants a pajmena?
 Ross:It’s a rug. (Jill winces.)
 Ross:Yeah. Everything but the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)
 Ross:Well. Hey…
 Ross:Oh yeah how about you and the (mimics her fake cry) I’m sorry!
 Ross:Oh stop.
 Ross:No you stop!
 Ross:(entering) Rach? Hi!
 Ross:Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
 Ross:Oh wow! I mean wow! I mean I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her never!
 Ross:Yeah but after you said it was okay I figured Why not?!
 Ross:I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey if you ever want to go out with Monica you have my blessing.
 Ross:(entering) Hi Jill!
 Ross:Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
 Ross:Rachel! Well you-you’re not at home you’re-you’re-you’re right here.
 Ross:Okay. So well I’ll umm (To Rachel) I’ll have her home by midnight.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Uhh it was okay. Yeah it was fun.
 Ross:I guess so.
 Ross:No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh show her slides of my favorite fossils.
 Ross:Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
 Ross:Anyway if she if she wasn’t in to me why-why would she ask me out again?
 Ross:Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night Valentine’s Day the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides if you know what I mean.
 Ross:(while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay. (Rachel stops.) It’s okay. Hey it’s too weird for you I won’t see her again.
 Ross:I mean after tomorrow night.
 Ross:Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.
 Ross:You want me to call her right now?
 Ross:Well umm oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
 Ross:Hey! Uh Phoebe’s not here is she?
 Ross:And-and I and I saw that Joey was about to go in so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. (They all kinda look at him.)
 Ross:Yeah! Good for you Joe!
 Ross:You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time I swear to… (Opens the door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh uh Jill. Umm that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm they’ve really taken a liking to me. (Quickly looks out to see if they’re watching.) Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?
 Ross:Of course what happened? (Lets her in.)
 Ross:Okay umm…
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Wow! Really?!
 Ross:Well I’d love to! Here you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!
 Ross:Ohh!
 Ross:Slides are almost ready.
 Ross:Uh okay well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.
 Ross:(answering it) Hello?
 Ross:O-okay Rach calm-calm down okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.
 Ross:So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
 Ross:Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.) Whoa! Uh that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.
 Ross:(To Rachel) You uh you may have been right about Jill.
 Ross:Umm she kissed me.
 Ross:Look I uh I tried not to kiss her okay?
 Ross:Let me finish okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…
 Ross:Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
 Ross:Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
 Ross:No I mean look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
 Ross:You’re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)
 Ross:You take care Jill.
 Ross:I know what you mean I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.
 Ross:The first time! No seriously imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.
 Ross:I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. (That’s karate he’s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know not doing anything else physical.
 Ross:No I just think Monica was that fat.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Hey do you guys think that if all those things happened we’d still hang out?
 Ross:(recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?
 Ross:No-no. It’s-it’s me Ross!
 Ross:No no-no Ross Geller.
 Ross:Yeah. Right.
 Ross:Good-good I’m-I’m married. (Shows her his ring.)
 Ross:Is-isn’t it the best?
 Ross:Oh really really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street umm do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
 Ross:Yeah? Oh-oh she’d be so excited!
 Ross:Come on! (They start to leave.)
 Ross:No it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him but I don’t…
 Ross:(putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.
 Ross:Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey here you go buddy. Sorry no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay let’s go see Monica!
 Ross:Hey Mon!
 Ross:Mon look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)
 Ross:And and uh you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)
 Ross:And that’s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)
 Ross:(answering it) 1987 the day after Christmas at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
 Ross:Sometimes you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime! I’ll play you one of my other…
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey-hey or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
 Ross:Come on Pheebs it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.
 Ross:Well umm I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Well last weekend…
 Ross:…will be two months…
 Ross:…since I stopped trying.
 Ross:What-what do you mean?
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Okay I think I got it.
 Ross:So honey this morning was fun huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
 Ross:Look Carol umm I was I was thinking maybe uh maybe we can spice things up a little.
 Ross:Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…
 Ross:Hey there little fella! Hey uh-hey why don’t we get some shoes on ya huh? Hey why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on in your room! Yay!!
 Ross:Yay! (To Carol) Seriously our sex life… I was thinking maybe I don’t know we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun?
 Ross:Well I don’t know umm (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carol’s shocked and obviously doesn’t like that idea.) Umm some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesn’t like that idea either.) Nah! Umm y’know we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm we could we could have a threesome.
 Ross:Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
 Ross:I got it!
 Ross:(on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she can’t come to the phone right now. (Listens.) Oh right no problem. Okay bye-bye. (Hangs up.)
 Ross:J-j-just relax nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
 Ross:(To Monica) Yeah she’s fired.
 Ross:So honey this uh this threesome thing umm I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…
 Ross:Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well someone’s been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
 Ross:Oh I know. (Laughs) Y’know just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…
 Ross:Yeah? Well I-I think Ben’s asleep.
 Ross:Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
 Ross:Hey Pheebs!
 Ross:Hey how’s it going?
 Ross:She doesn’t know she was fired yet does she?
 Ross:Hey Pheebs maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
 Ross:We’re really gonna do this huh?
 Ross:Y’know if if this is too weird for you we can still back out at… (A knock on the door interrupts him.)
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:I’m-I’m Ross by the way.
 Ross:How hot is this?!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Look at you! You’re up!
 Ross:Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?
 Ross:No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:It was it was okay.
 Ross:Look it’s just did did you ever go to a party and think Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?
 Ross:Oh-oh absolutely!
 Ross:It’s just my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then and then there was a lot of waiting around.
 Ross:Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
 Ross:No she kept kicking me away!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Oh I a lot of stuff!
 Ross:A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
 Ross:Just a sandwich. Turkey a little mustard…
 Ross:It really was!
 Ross:Hey Rachel.
 Ross:Umm no.
 Ross:That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Okay. (He does so.)
 Ross:We’re sorry.
 Ross:Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?
 Ross:Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker look can I just say not all men are like that.
 Ross:Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
 Ross:Men. I guy I know.
 Ross:She is not… (Realizes) She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.
 Ross:I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
 Ross:Try telling my wife that.
 Ross:Hey remember when I had a monkey?
 Ross:Yeah what what was I thinking?
 Ross:What’s up with the greed Joe?
 Ross:Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean can’t-can’t you pick up I don’t know an extra shift here?
 Ross:Oh wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Hey what have you guys been up to?
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:After one class? I don’t think so.
 Ross:Well of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming that’s not enough. Look I studying kara-tay for a long time and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.
 Ross:No it’s a concept!
 Ross:All right maybe it means that too…
 Ross:Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!
 Ross:Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
 Ross:(moves closer) All I’m saying is it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack I don’t know like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel’s and screams) surprise!!
 Ross:All right you know that one was coming but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)
 Ross:Y’know what… (Moves away as Chandler enters panicked.)
 Ross:No.
 Ross:So what are you gonna do?
 Ross:DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
 Ross:A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing every time now.)
 Ross:Perhaps. Now I’m curious at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
 Ross:I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point but I—look I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage and Ross screams…) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.) Ahhh huh? Unagi.
 Ross:(not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.
 Ross:Unagi. I’m always aware.
 Ross:What’s up?
 Ross:Oh why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
 Ross:Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. (Picks up a model of the Saturn V rocket that’s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
 Ross:Yeah-yeah except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve 1968. They also took the famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
 Ross:Y’know what? I can easily get out of this but there is a chance you can get very very hurt!
 Ross:It’s a great class.
 Ross:Yeah yeah I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.) Umm hey a couple of questions though. Umm about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor what-what-what-what would you do next?
 Ross:No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
 Ross:Yes that’s right.
 Ross:I tired attacking two women did not work.
 Ross:No I mean it’s okay I mean they’re-they’re my friends. In fact I-I-I was married to one of them.
 Ross:Oh no! No-no! No I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that’s a no.
 Ross:Ah-ha nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)
 Ross:DANGER!!!!
 Ross:Hey! I just got uh my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!
 Ross:Oh I wish I knew but the evaluations are all anonymous.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:It’s a girl! Anyway it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.
 Ross:No but it is frowned upon.
 Ross:Besides there’s a big age difference.
 Ross:I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.
 Ross:(startled) Yeah?
 Ross:Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
 Ross:That was you?
 Ross:Oh I I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.
 Ross:What time?
 Ross:Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
 Ross:Oh! So-so seriously what time?
 Ross:What? Of course I did! You uh you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
 Ross:Oh uh I had trouble remembering everyone’s name so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
 Ross:Umm no. No.
 Ross:Umm it’s Cutie McPretty.
 Ross:Listen I gotta tell ya I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird the whole student teacher thing and to be frank I thought it would be too but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
 Ross:(pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
 Ross:We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
 Ross:Well not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night Judgey von Holierthanthou.
 Ross:Yeah. What-what should I do?
 Ross:Going out with who?
 Ross:Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for big boobies.)
 Ross:What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
 Ross:Oh you have some studying to do?
 Ross:Y’know I remember when uh when I was in college we used to… (He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
 Ross:Nothing I’m-I’m just I’m so comfortable with you!
 Ross:What? No! Of course of course I do! Are-are they gone?
 Ross:What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.) Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
 Ross:That’s right Lydia Elizabeth here is a student and uh we’re dating. And you may frown upon that but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Really? Its not just frowned upon?
 Ross:Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
 Ross:I know I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh it’s wrong.
 Ross:(feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.
 Ross:Let’s also get a hot plate!
 Ross:Hey everybody!
 Ross:Hey uh this is Elizabeth.
 Ross:Oh no-no-no we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)
 Ross:Bye.
 Ross:Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)
 Ross:Yes her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
 Ross:Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!
 Ross:I don’t know Rachel why?
 Ross:Well thanks!
 Ross:Well actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious which is perfect for me right now.
 Ross:Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…
 Ross:Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh a student I don’t know.
 Ross:Yes yes of course what-what would this be regarding?
 Ross:Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course why don’t we go inside?
 Ross:Oh-ooh!
 Ross:Doorknob! Doorknob!
 Ross:Oh okay. What-what about?
 Ross:Spring vacation.
 Ross:(quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes professor Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So I will take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)
 Ross:You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
 Ross:I can do that. Oh-oh what if she gets upset?
 Ross:What the hell are you doing?
 Ross:What?! What? How do you how do you even know its broken?!
 Ross:Joey I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.
 Ross:Do not give him any money!
 Ross:Yes. Yes! Please come in.
 Ross:Oo-oo!
 Ross:Yeah it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually I wanted to finish talking to you about uh spring vacation.
 Ross:Look I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.
 Ross:No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…
 Ross:That! Let’s talk about that.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Huh? Oh-oh it was fine. Uh it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.
 Ross:What’s-what’s the difference?
 Ross:Hey y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
 Ross:I went to Egypt with my dad.
 Ross:Hey I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than Spring break! (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!
 Ross:I’m gonna call her.
 Ross:Well it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means that means wet T-shirt contests guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies waking up next to people you don’t even know…
 Ross:Okay she can’t go.
 Ross:Then what am I supposed to do?
 Ross:Well what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
 Ross:I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!
 Ross:Sure. Sure. Look I don’t I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet but umm hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
 Ross:Are you into crafts at all?
 Ross:Well yeah of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip and-and (notices something) what-what is uh what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
 Ross:To wear in front of people?
 Ross:Is this?!
 Ross:So uh have a great time down there.
 Ross:Yeah. And did you did you pack that bathing suit?
 Ross:It was pretty funny when I when I hid it for a while huh? Anyway umm I-I am worried about that bathing suit not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with no I’m concerned about your health sun exposure.
 Ross:Well if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30 sometimes it’s-it’s get 4 and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:Okay. Cool.
 Ross:Call me!
 Ross: Excuse me?
 Ross:Youre right youre right it is.
 Ross: So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
 Ross:It’s your turn.
 Ross:Wait a minute are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?
 Ross:Totally!
 Ross:Great!
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Oh I love that guy! (Laughs.)
 Ross:(stops laughing) What am I doing?
 Ross:Look don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.
 Ross:Yeah none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
 Ross: Oh my God!
 Ross:You ate my sandwich?
 Ross:(getting upset) Oh-oh really?
 Ross:(jumping to his feet in anger) What?
 Ross:You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
 Ross: (losing control we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
 Ross:MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Rosss scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Yes yes it is. In prison!
 Ross:It took two people to break up this relationship!!
 Ross:I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
 Ross:I fell asleep!
 Ross:It was 530 in the morning and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room trapping Monica Chandler and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh and by the way Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
 Ross:(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
 Ross:That’ll be a neat trick when you’re (looks at the script) when you’re dead!
 Ross:There was just an explosion okay? My hearing would be impaired.
 Ross:Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
 Ross:Oh my God. I mean…
 Ross:Totally.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:What are you guys doing later?
 Ross:(continuing) I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.
 Ross:Come on guys I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
 Ross:Thanks!
 Ross:It-it’s great to meet you Paul.
 Ross:Of course of course Mr. Stevens.
 Ross:Eh-wh—Excuse me?
 Ross:That’s funny. Umm…. (Pause then serious) It’s not funny.
 Ross:Okay. I can I can see that. Umm but I think if you give me umm one chance I can I can change your mind.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:This is—you—(Ross starts laughing.)
 Ross:Okay umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean I mean I’ve been in um relationships in general uh but I have never done it with a student—I mean I not—not it! I mean I mean I don’t—We haven’t done it. Uh I mean I mean we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay okay a joke a joke—lighten the mood. Umm two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
 Ross:And the Irish guy wins the joke!
 Ross:Oh God thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm uh Mr. Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh this is Phoebe Monica and Chandler.
 Ross:Okay umm why don’t we all take a seat y’know? And uh and I’ll get us all some uh some coffees—(He goes to pull out Elizabeth’s chair but Paul steps in)—Yeah why don’t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and you guys can talk about whatever whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler Monica and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)
 Ross:(returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul Elizabeth. (He sets down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
 Ross:Joey?!
 Ross:Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)
 Ross:Okay I’ll just wait for him in here!
 Ross:(coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!
 Ross:What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
 Ross:(incredulous) In your mouth?!
 Ross:You were at the coffeehouse!
 Ross:He is my girlfriend’s father okay? It’s-it’s it’s weird!
 Ross:That was different!
 Ross:This is weird for me!
 Ross:How is that important?
 Ross:Yeah take your time.
 Ross:(to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as…
 Ross:Not all bad.
 Ross:Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
 Ross:No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
 Ross:Yeah well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm uh and just so you know Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife! (Realizes) Oh I’m sorry! (To Elizabeth) It’s unbelievable!
 Ross:You’re back.
 Ross:Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me frankly…
 Ross:God no!
 Ross:Well if it doesn’t matter to her it doesn’t matter to me! (to Paul) Still not yelling!
 Ross:That’s okay I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.
 Ross:Uh yeah I guess—Yeah! I guess so.
 Ross:Ohhh! Kids!
 Ross:That’s okay Rach we’re not liking Ross right now.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Why? What?
 Ross:No no that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on let it go y’know? Stop it! Besides Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father so ah he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils huh?
 Ross:Okay okay. Uh well uh Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.
 Ross:Oh come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know ‘cause-‘cause y’know ‘cause he’s all old and…
 Ross:Really? That okay that’s great.
 Ross:All right look I-I realize it upsets you.
 Ross:But Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.
 Ross:Ohh! A man with a plan!
 Ross:This place is really beautiful!
 Ross:Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs but but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?
 Ross:Ehh I was just I was just thinking about your father.
 Ross:No. No-no uh he just he just really freaked me out before.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh protection. Yeah-no yeah-no that-that-that I forgot.
 Ross:Oh no! Hey-hey I’m the guy! I’ll get it.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:A little bit.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Ohh okay.
 Ross:What are you doing here?!
 Ross:Yeah I recognize the ankles!
 Ross:(under the couch) You and your ice.
 Ross:(before entering) Did you really hear a bear?
 Ross:Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I’m gonna go out this window. (Points to the window next to him.) I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home okay?
 Ross:(to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
 Ross:Okay please-please Paul just let me explain…
 Ross:All right fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)
 Ross:And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics Paul’s flexing.)
 Ross:Oh perfect we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
 Ross:How rude.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Great to see you!
 Ross:How you doing?
 Ross:Okay! You take care!
 Ross:Hey Pheebs what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
 Ross:Phoebe why’d you do it?
 Ross:What?! Why?!
 Ross:I can’t think of anything.
 Ross:Wait a minute is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
 Ross:I guess it could.
 Ross:Well if he’s angry he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
 Ross:Hey remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
 Ross:Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
 Ross:Okay. Well apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
 Ross:Yeah! Anyway I-I still think we should try to patch things up y’know? Like uh maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
 Ross:Oh. (Starts to get his money)
 Ross:All the time?
 Ross:Hey! So uh was he excited about the tickets?
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
 Ross:Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!
 Ross:That’s right!
 Ross:Eh? We’ll show him!
 Ross:Wait a minute is this is this for real?
 Ross:So you two are really serious?!
 Ross:You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be brothers-in-law! (They hug.)
 Ross:Hey-hey Pheebs!
 Ross:Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
 Ross:You told her before you told us?
 Ross:God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
 Ross:Yeah you didn’t get one.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Oh no I have plans with Elizabeth.
 Ross:I’m sorry it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!
 Ross:I don’t know.
 Ross:Wait a minute does-does everyone feel this way?
 Ross:Uh-uh—Wow! Uh I thought you guys were just like making jokes I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean I’m the one dating Elizabeth not you!
 Ross:Yeah yeah you have the ring?
 Ross:(to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
 Ross:What’s-what’s going on?
 Ross:Oh you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building!
 Ross:Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm I I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is the same…
 Ross:No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay look can I can I just-just talk to you for a second?
 Ross:Uh so this play umm what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh…
 Ross:(screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
 Ross:Oh my God you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)
 Ross:Who?
 Ross:What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.
 Ross:Yeah I was but uh she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
 Ross:Y’know maybe she is too young for me. Y’know when I was over there and she was running around with her friends I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.
 Ross:Okay umm bad stuff. Well I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.
 Ross:Hmm.
 Ross:Okay good stuff. Umm well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…
 Ross:No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay honestly no. I don’t I don’t see a big future with her.
 Ross:I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh I hate this part.
 Ross:(in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
 Ross:Elizabeth thank God! I was just thinking about…
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Okay break-up’s still on!
 Ross:What happened you guys?
 Ross:Rach!
 Ross:Hey come on in.
 Ross:Oh thanks. Yeah I really thought we’d be able to make it work but uh I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.
 Ross:I guess so.
 Ross:Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
 Ross:Ohh yeah I already have one.
 Ross:Phoebe.
 Ross:Ohh I don’t think so.
 Ross:That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Phoebe how could you do this to me?!
 Ross:I was not!
 Ross:No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!
 Ross:Ooh I wanna switch to Rachel too!
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:Hey what’s going on?
 Ross:I found a note on my door Come to Monica’s quick bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar.
 Ross:What’s up?
 Ross:Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.
 Ross:Where is she?
 Ross:Oh I thought it was just a kid yelling I’m gay! I’m gay! Can I bring her in?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Wow! Happy Monica’s night!
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:Well sure. But I get married all the time so…
 Ross:You okay?
 Ross:You mean we—you and me?
 Ross:Oh good you scared me for a minute.
 Ross:I mean—no it’s just ‘cause it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No but there was some good times.
 Ross:Surely you can think of something good.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
 Ross:My hands?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:(to his hands) Way to go guys. Y’know you-you were really good at the stuff too.
 Ross:A what?
 Ross:One night just-just sex. No strings attached?
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Okay this is getting a little crazy. I mean I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really really…don’t.
 Ross:Okay Monica. Mon uh what-what you just saw…
 Ross:It is! It is!
 Ross:Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
 Ross:Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!
 Ross:Oh no!
 Ross:And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
 Ross:Guess who? (Enters fully.)
 Ross:Hey I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…
 Ross:Still thinking about it huh?
 Ross:(loosening his tie) Oh who cares?
 Ross:(tightening his tie) And so do I.
 Ross:Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
 Ross:(sitting up) No! (Exits.)
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey here’s a thought.
 Ross:Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
 Ross:Uh Rachel I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.
 Ross:Look uh if we’re gonna do this…
 Ross:Oh I see so everybody wins.
 Ross:Oww!
 Ross:(deadpan) Well I’m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.
 Ross:(at the door) And uh Rachel.
 Ross:What can I say you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Oh I’ll have some!
 Ross:Take from me as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
 Ross:Oh my God the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!
 Ross:And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at… (Phoebe rushes in.)
 Ross:Phoebe oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
 Ross:Oh my God! Of course of course. (To the class.) Umm would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you… (Motions that they should learn everyone’s hometown.) (To Phoebe) Wh-what’s going on?
 Ross:Umm okay yeah sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
 Ross:Phoebe you said it was urgent!
 Ross:Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
 Ross:Uh Phoebe…
 Ross:Phoebe what are you doing?
 Ross:Phoebe!
 Ross:Phoebe you can’t massage people in my apartment!
 Ross:And they knew about it?
 Ross:Look this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
 Ross:The big deal is I don’t want naked greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.
 Ross:Hello.
 Ross:Uh no-no she-she’s out for the night.
 Ross:Can I can I help you with something?
 Ross:(deadpan) Yes I am.
 Ross:Okay! Now I’m going to touch you. (He does so very gingerly.) Ohh that’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)
 Ross:(sitting down) Hey what are you guys what are you guys talking about?
 Ross:(takes a drink) Damn this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)
 Ross:So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
 Ross:(chases her) Oh yeah yeah? Well uh when we were going out I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) ‘Sup?
 Ross:(looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?
 Ross:(incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
 Ross:Okay so it wasn’t uh a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And and I gently exfoliated him with with a mop.
 Ross:Hey y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.
 Ross:He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right you’re right. I’m sorry.
 Ross:His daughter was hot.
 Ross:About what?
 Ross:Well you-you’ve always had glasses.
 Ross:Are you sure?
 Ross:(entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler what are you doing tonight?
 Ross:No why?
 Ross:My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
 Ross:Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you he asked for Chancy I assumed he meant you.
 Ross:No I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
 Ross:Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:You’re not a lefty?
 Ross:Oh we have to get you an engagement present?
 Ross:No one got me an engagement present.
 Ross:Two! I’ve been engaged twice!
 Ross:(entering with Chandler) Hey.
 Ross:Well I had a great time! Umm Chancy on the other hand…
 Ross:And what did he ask you not to call him?
 Ross:Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
 Ross:‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
 Ross:Now I know you wanted to bond with my dad but did you really have to bond to that part?
 Ross:Oh but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
 Ross:Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
 Ross:You were trying to eat it!
 Ross:Whoa-whoa aren’t you a little over dressed?
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.
 Ross:You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
 Ross:Let’s give it a shot.
 Ross:Ohh these are pretty good.
 Ross:Which one was that?
 Ross:Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) I’m okay.
 Ross:Yeah ooh yeah I think there is one from batch 17 left uh… (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
 Ross:Looking up?
 Ross:Aww Pheeb come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about what about your sister?
 Ross:That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit I’ve got shuffleboard that day.
 Ross:Ohhhh…
 Ross:It wasn’t the best.
 Ross:Well the lighting was okay.
 Ross:Oh great! That means I’m stuck with So we were watching you in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Oh nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner.
 Ross:(notices the table) Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that dinner stuff? You making dinner?
 Ross:What you got over there? Tacos?
 Ross:Uhh those are tacos.
 Ross:Eh either way I’ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can’t eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What’s so funny?!
 Ross:(To Chandler) You told her!
 Ross:(To Monica) Look okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said Umm what would make this ride more fun?!
 Ross:(To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
 Ross:Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
 Ross:Well Chandler and I are in a bar…
 Ross:And this girl is making eyes at Chandler okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh after a minute or two I see them kissing. Now I know what you’re thinking Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls and you’re right Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
 Ross:Oh Mon I laughed so hard…
 Ross:Whatever dude you kissed a guy.
 Ross:All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
 Ross:Oh is that funny?! Oh you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
 Ross:Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.
 Ross:Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
 Ross:Ohh! Ohh! In college Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
 Ross:Whatever dude you kissed a guy.
 Ross:And in my defense the cleaning lady came on to me!
 Ross:And! We should keep all the stuff uh we told each other secret from everybody else.
 Ross:Okay (gets up) if you’ll excuse me I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.
 Ross:Man! (Monica mouths I’m sorry.)
 Ross:(To Chandler) Dude that reverse lay-up! Oh…
 Ross:Amazing!
 Ross:Oh you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy we call him Hums While He Pees.
 Ross:It’s not a club.
 Ross:Hey divorced men are not bad men!
 Ross:Soon he’ll be able to call you that lady he knew who got fired.
 Ross:Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.
 Ross:I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
 Ross:I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say I love you and that’s why I have to kill you.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:What?! No!
 Ross:Look I don’t think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)
 Ross:All right! I want my key back!
 Ross:It’s right there! (Points to her hand.)
 Ross:Look I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
 Ross:Oh yeah—No—You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later.
 Ross:Hi Whitney.
 Ross:Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
 Ross:(opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I’m sorry but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman who by the way did not spend the night.
 Ross:Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
 Ross:Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people!
 Ross:Like what?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Pheebs come on! I mean consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now if you’ll excuse me…
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Listen you are hearing one side of the story okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.
 Ross:Well I don’t think we are gonna have that problem but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
 Ross:I think he can be.
 Ross:Well excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
 Ross:(angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
 Ross:So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.) I’m sorry you had to see that.
 Ross:My God!
 Ross:Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
 Ross:Wh-what’s up?
 Ross:Oh just say it Kyle!
 Ross:(To Whitney) Y’know he hums when he pees!
 Ross:It makes him miss the bowl but whatever.
 Ross:That’s all right we-we don’t need you. In fact hey I’m over it already.
 Ross:(To Phoebe) I’m sorry. Ugh Pheebs you were you were right about her. Y’know she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah I hurt my back a little.
 Ross:Yeah were better off without them.
 Ross:Divorced men’s club.
 Ross:Joey we just saw it!
 Ross:And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
 Ross:Dude you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
 Ross:Well John McLane had plans!
 Ross:What happened?!!
 Ross:We fell asleep! That is all.
 Ross:I think that would be best.
 Ross:Okay. But not about this!
 Ross:No touch! No touch!
 Ross:Wow this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
 Ross:Just uh brought back your videos.
 Ross:No! No we don’t!
 Ross:I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
 Ross:I’ve had better.
 Ross:All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
 Ross:I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
 Ross:We can’t do it again.
 Ross:Because it’s weird!
 Ross:Sure what do you got?
 Ross:No 10 is the highest.
 Ross:Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay Rachel you’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1 You’re with Monica the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)
 Ross:Yes very nice Rachel.
 Ross:(playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl I remember that—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
 Ross:It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
 Ross:Go!
 Ross:Yeah it really was!
 Ross:Okay Phoebe I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I really don’t see the point.
 Ross:I’m sorry Rach it was it was really close.
 Ross:Actually it wasn’t that close.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Why-why would I care about that?
 Ross:It really was.
 Ross:(slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
 Ross:Okay okay take a guess.
 Ross:Okay okay I was typing names into the library computer earlier y’know-y’know for fun and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way towards a secluded section behind the racks.)
 Ross:(stopping quickly) Oh umm there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?
 Ross:People are doing it in front of my book!
 Ross:My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school I went to see it and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
 Ross:Let me ask you something at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh fool around.
 Ross:Great! Because people kept showing up I think it’s like uh-a thing!
 Ross:Oh for cryin’ out loud! (He storms out.)
 Ross:Excuse me. Hi I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section fifth floor stack 437?
 Ross:No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)
 Ross:Hi I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well rolling around in front of it.
 Ross:Well fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!
 Ross:Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
 Ross:Oh-oh you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for hmm? Perhaps (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
 Ross:Ah… Ah…Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.) Uh meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?
 Ross:I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
 Ross:I’m a professor here uh Ross…Geller.
 Ross:Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!
 Ross:Well I uh I skipped forth grade.
 Ross:I am very…very sorry.
 Ross:(to the guard) Don’t sweat it I’ve got this section covered. Yeah in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay see you later.
 Ross:(entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
 Ross:What are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
 Ross:What? Thats like insanely easy!
 Ross:What? You forgot fourteen states?
 Ross:Wow how many have you got?
 Ross:Done! With time a-to-spare.
 Ross:You know I hate to lecture you guys but its kinda disgraceful that a group of well-educated adults and Joey cant name all the states. Did you ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe? Hmm?
 Ross:What? Thats impossible.
 Ross:No just give me another minute.
 Ross:This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right uhh I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
 Ross:Youre on!
 Ross:Pshhshhh!
 Ross:Phoebe why is your bag moving?
 Ross:Ohio!! Thank you!
 Ross:What dog? There-theres no dog here.
 Ross:Are you out of your mind?
 Ross:Right they are scary. (He jumps up screaming) Ahh she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
 Ross:Its too cold.
 Ross:(to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
 Ross:How can I not get this? Im a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
 Ross:Damn I forgot you were here.
 Ross:Hey! Whats she doing back here?
 Ross:Hey look Phoebe. I uh I laid out the states geographically...
 Ross:Yeah but but look what Im...
 Ross:Um in Phoebes room. You cant go in there.
 Ross:Monicas crying. Shes very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
 Ross:No. No no. She doesnt want to see you right now.
 Ross:Because you sent away the dog!
 Ross:Oh is it? Is it? Look when Monica and I were kids we had a dog named Rover. And uh one day my dad decides he doesnt like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Dont you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
 Ross:From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter like hes almost crying) Yes please!
 Ross:I hate America! When I finish this game I swear I am moving.
 Ross:Okay maybe this is so hard because there arent 50 states. Let me tell you something I have 49 states and there are no more! I-I think I should be able to eat something.
 Ross:Tag? Y-Youre going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didnt uh we didnt get the chance to talk. Uh so where did you say youre from again?
 Ross:Ah what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)
 Ross:Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
 Ross:(hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!
 Ross:(pauses) I know.
 Ross:You sure?
 Ross:No-no one daddy two mommies. All right it’s all yours. (Ross pushes him off.)
 Ross:Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(shocked) What?!
 Ross:Ohh.
 Ross:That is so unfair!
 Ross:Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!! (Monica runs to make more candy.) Pheebs you uh you got a second.
 Ross:Yeah ever since you uh told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean everyone should have a-a first bike so…
 Ross:You like it?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Ahh.
 Ross:Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh t-take it downstairs y’know give it a test ride.
 Ross:(stunned at the complement) You’re welcome.
 Ross:Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
 Ross:Wait a minute she was walking the bike? Both times?
 Ross:Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?
 Ross:Okay now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…
 Ross:Phoebe you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
 Ross:Well…In-in case of emergency.
 Ross:Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you.
 Ross:Okay Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:I swear!
 Ross:Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right here we go. All right? (They start.)
 Ross:All right. Feel good?
 Ross:All right try pedaling.
 Ross:That’s it your doing great.
 Ross:Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
 Ross:Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
 Ross:I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…
 Ross:It’s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!
 Ross:Hey there’s uh some people outside askin’ about candy.
 Ross:Need some help?
 Ross:By the way the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe’s room.)
 Ross:(entering) Look I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
 Ross:I know. I know. But can we please try it again? Huh? I mean you were so close Phoebe!
 Ross:Phoebe.
 Ross:All right y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry I’m just gonna have to take it back.
 Ross:Because! Because it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.
 Ross:Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You’re making the bike very happy.
 Ross:Oh hey don’t thank me thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:(Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey I just found out I get Ben for the holidays this year.
 Ross:Nope. I mean I know Susan does every year but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.

 Ross:(to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
 Ross:Thats right Ben. Im Santas representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But Santa sent me here to give you these presents Ben. (He tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents but cant because of the costume) Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
 Ross:Youre welcome Ben. Merry Christmas ooh and Happy Hanukkah!
 Ross:(gasps) You are? Me too!
 Ross:(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh hey Ben what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?

 Ross:Im sorry Chandler but this this is really important to me.
 Ross:Okay Ben Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
 Ross:Fine I-I give up. Santa Santa can stay.
 Ross:All right its time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
 Ross:…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day burned for…
 Ross:That’s right and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa Superman Monica Ben and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
 Ross:Come on come on we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!

 Ross:Come on come on we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!
 Ross:Well technically it seven billion years ago… (Well technically you’d be able to see it for days well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of New York.)
 Ross:Okay! Okay! Fine I’ll stop! No teaching okay? We’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don’t streak across the sky meteors do.) Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King.
 Ross:Man look at all those stars! (Yeah you can see what? Five of them from the city?) Infinite space. It really really makes you wonder doesn’t it?
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey’s standing.)
 Ross:Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
 Ross:Show me where?
 Ross:(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open?
 Ross:Joey!
 Ross:It’s called the Bapstein-King comet okay? (Joey starts to groan.) Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
 Ross:Rachel!! Monica!!
 Ross:I can’t believe this!!
 Ross:(standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah I guess we don’t have a choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!
 Ross:(To Joey) I know I wasn’t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.) (Yelling at the street) But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!!
 Ross:Ugh. Well we’re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah. Now we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.
 Ross:Yeah! Oh yeah you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.
 Ross:Well I’m gonna lie to you Joey it’s a possibility.
 Ross:Oh all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?
 Ross:Okay. Well you be careful.
 Ross:Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!
 Ross:(looking in the window behind them) Y’know y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window crawl through and-and y’know explain later.
 Ross:I don’t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass which angers the big large angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.) When you get in there… (Joey nods his disapproval.)
 Ross:Okay do-do you have a good grip?
 Ross:Okay I’m going to start climb down you now.
 Ross:Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
 Ross:I would say that.
 Ross:Okay here I go.
 Ross:I prefer not to answer that right now I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
 Ross:So what do you want me to do?
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:(looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
 Ross:It’s still looks pretty far!
 Ross:Do not rush me!!
 Ross:Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I—Ooh a quarter!
 Ross:Hey y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say This is my brother-in-law Ross. Not My friend Ross brother-in-law Ross. That’s weird isn’t it?
 Ross:(disappointed) Sure do whatever you want.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!
 Ross:I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!
 Ross:(on phone) Uh hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes we’re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?
 Ross:I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.
 Ross:They kept your room for a while.
 Ross:Come on you know they love you.
 Ross:I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:What’s wrong with this year?
 Ross:Hey y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Dad?
 Ross:(entering with Monica) Hey!
 Ross:Dad we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.
 Ross:(To Monica) Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
 Ross:Yeah not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
 Ross:Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?
 Ross:Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey check this out dad (reading his grades) Math A. Science A. History A. Gym…(He puts it away and finds something else.) Oooh my rock polisher!
 Ross:It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:How are you ever going to sell this place?
 Ross:Oh no. Dad! Dad! What…(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.) Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad she’s gonna be crushed!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Dad that won’t matter to her. Look all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is is growing new stuff! See this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
 Ross:Well can you blame her?
 Ross:Dad dad I don’t want to hear about it.
 Ross:Well not right now. Okay look Monica came here for some memories and damnit we’re gonna give her some! Okay grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.
 Ross:Like uh y’know like this! This! (He picks up one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could’ve made this!
 Ross:Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could’ve won this!
 Ross:Sure! Ooh-ooh what about this?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:(overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh this will make a great memory.
 Ross:Well these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
 Ross:Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)
 Ross:Oh I don’t know how that got in there.
 Ross:Umm your boxes are umm…
 Ross:Dad?
 Ross:All right. I think it was a mouse.
 Ross:(even more shocked) What?!!!
 Ross:Well w-w-w-w-wait w-wait wait wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
 Ross:Well what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!
 Ross:Happy birthday!!!
 Ross:We’ve got presents!
 Ross:Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
 Ross:Hey 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
 Ross:Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
 Ross:How hot do I look in this huh?!
 Ross:That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
 Ross:(giddy) I don’t know but-but look how shiny!
 Ross:Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
 Ross:Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
 Ross:Okay forward. Forward—Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to the back of the car.) Okay back—Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to the front.) Okay forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!
 Ross:No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine. (The woman walks away.)
 Ross:Maybe that will liven up this party.
 Ross:(to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
 Ross:Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?
 Ross:What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group then goes and sits down.)
 Ross:Which is fine! Because you just turned—(Removes two candles from the cake)—twenty-eight!
 Ross:(To Monica) You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.
 Ross:I really wish that you wouldn’t.
 Ross:Come on!
 Ross:Okay is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!
 Ross:(interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!
 Ross:All right everyone lift! (They and try to lift the car of course it doesn’t raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over but the car still does not move.)
 Ross:God do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?
 Ross:Yes! My baby’s finally free!
 Ross:(starting it) Woohoo!
 Ross:You wanna buy a car?
 Ross:What’s the matter? You okay?
 Ross:Okay. Yeah I guess I guess I could do that too.
 Ross:Yeah I kind of uh have something else planned for you guys.
 Ross:Sorry I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
 Ross:What? A brain transplant?!
 Ross:It’s ridiculous!
 Ross:(to Monica and Rachel) It’s winter they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod knowingly.)
 Ross:Yeah-yeah help me out here when you come out of the brain transplant you are going to be her?
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Oh well it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh rediscover its Scottish roots.
 Ross:Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
 Ross:How did you know about that?!
 Ross:Were you the ones called the cops?!
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
 Ross:No you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.
 Ross:…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
 Ross:(To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
 Ross:(stands up) Now umm remember I’m still learning.
 Ross:One two three four!
 Ross:You know the song! Sing along!
 Ross:So?
 Ross:You know the song! Sing along!
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Hi we have a little bathroom emergency.
 Ross:Uh before we do uh are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there?
 Ross:(to Ben) Okay! All clear!
 Ross:(to Ben) Everything okay in there?
 Ross:Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
 Ross:Oh she isn’t home.
 Ross:Well Ben would be there.
 Ross:What’s the matter?
 Ross:Rach he’s not an ex-con.
 Ross:I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
 Ross:Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
 Ross:(To Rachel) I wasn’t talking to you.
 Ross:Okay I’ll see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in an hour.
 Ross:I have a bone to pick with you.
 Ross:Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
 Ross:That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
 Ross:Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
 Ross:I was barefoot. Now tell me the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
 Ross:Rachel! What are you doing here?
 Ross:Your good friend?
 Ross:What’s her last name?
 Ross:Nice. And by the way that uh that line down my face?
 Ross:Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh (In a college frat boy voice) Dude don’t you ever was your face?
 Ross:Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Practical jokes.
 Ross:You have a line down your face.
 Ross:Uh y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
 Ross:I will be! Listen I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
 Ross:No that’s not what I want. Uh I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel so…
 Ross:Okay I’ll see you later pal.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That’s great. That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
 Ross:All right that’s it! (He runs over to Ben but he runs past him and out the door.) Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!
 Ross:Wait! No! Ben come here! I am not kidding!
 Ross:I-I-am—(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)
 Ross:(noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh go try to talk to her?
 Ross:Uh yeah! Let me let me get that for you.
 Ross:(exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.) (Calmly) So hi I’m uh I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly waves.)
 Ross:Kristen hi. Are you uh new to the area ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime.
 Ross:Ah.
 Ross:Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talking about.)
 Ross:Umm say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Great! Uh let me take this up for you. (The box he’s holding.)
 Ross:Oh no-no after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When she’s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can’t pick it up.)
 Ross:Laugh all you want but uh she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.
 Ross:Yeah in fact I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)
 Ross:(returning) Hey.
 Ross:Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.
 Ross:Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!
 Ross:Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
 Ross:Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively I think I should date her…
 Ross:That’s interesting but check this out. I date her…
 Ross:Okay okay. This can go on for a while.
 Ross:No Joey! Look why don’t why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.
 Ross:Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…
 Ross:Well sorry that’s what I do on dates.
 Ross:So let’s decide on the spending limit…
 Ross:I was thinking more like a hundred.
 Ross:Hey! What’s up?
 Ross:Oh thanks!
 Ross:We have 800 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
 Ross:I am dressed.
 Ross:I have an oily T-zone!
 Ross:That’s right.
 Ross:Uh actually I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
 Ross:Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
 Ross:Why am I not surprised?
 Ross:I don’t think you have much choice.
 Ross:Bye-bye!
 Ross:Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).
 Ross:So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
 Ross:Hi. (They shake hands.) It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.
 Ross:Yeah. So…
 Ross:So Joey umm you look familiar. Are uh are you on TV or something?
 Ross:That’s right! That’s right don’t you play a woman?
 Ross:Much better.
 Ross:Well yes yes I have. In fact umm just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.
 Ross:That’s right! Wait no Ben.
 Ross:Well umm…
 Ross:Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
 Ross:Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
 Ross:Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
 Ross:Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
 Ross:Probably around gonorrhea.
 Ross:Yeah laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin!
 Ross:…and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis?
 Ross:Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
 Ross:Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn’t know what to make of it.) Of course this is just conjecture. Okay that’s uh that’s all for today. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse can I see you for a moment?
 Ross:Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam I’m afraid I-I had to fail you.
 Ross:Well you need 60% to pass…
 Ross:Seven.
 Ross:No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?
 Ross:Well I’m sorry but that-that’s really not my problem.
 Ross:Well that brings me in the loop a little.
 Ross:Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm I uh I’m your teacher. I’m sorry you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
 Ross:Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
 Ross:There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.
 Ross:I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
 Ross:Yeah! I don’t know. I mean last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? (Rachel and Joey both look at him.)
 Ross:It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
 Ross:Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
 Ross:(turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis how can I help you?
 Ross:And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
 Ross:(turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Well that’s different! Okay? Because he he was actually in love with me!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
 Ross:Uh Mr. Morse can I speak to you for a moment?
 Ross:Uh-hmm yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.
 Ross:‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.
 Ross:Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay—(Ned looks shocked)—Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston Professor Fredrickson I’ll be right with you. (To Ned) Don’t make this worse and I’ll give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)
 Ross:A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
 Ross:Cassie?
 Ross:Wow I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
 Ross:So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.
 Ross:What—why?
 Ross:What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!
 Ross:Fine she can stay at my place. By the way what-what does Cassie even look like now.
 Ross:(shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh. Oh that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.
 Ross:It’s okay. Come come on in.
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
 Ross:Yeah—No!!
 Ross:Cassie how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.
 Ross:(quietly) Thank God.
 Ross:Oh right. Right. Ooh remember the time I uh I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? (She laughs) We’re probably too old to do that now.
 Ross:(looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
 Ross:Well I’m I’m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children would be.
 Ross:(in his head) She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! (She grabs some popcorn.) Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run the sexiest movie ever. (She grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.
 Ross:(in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay doesn’t have to be clever it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause) There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To her) I-I I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his head) Yeah you really shouldn’t have said anything.
 Ross:She seems really really fun!
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:So that’s two of my wives.
 Ross:Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
 Ross:No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux Batman’s tux!
 Ross:That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.
 Ross:So?
 Ross:Well you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
 Ross:Pretty please? Not very uh 007.
 Ross:When I got married you slept with my sister.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
 Ross:Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
 Ross:Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
 Ross:What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!
 Ross:Okay but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
 Ross:Well with Carol I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
 Ross:Well why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm Monica from the moment I met you I knew I loved you.
 Ross:...everyone this is Chandler!
 Ross:(Screaming) I’m getting married today!! Ahh whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh we were helping Chandler write his vows but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
 Ross:How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
 Ross:I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!
 Ross:Phoebe that’s not true.
 Ross:Believe me it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
 Ross:(entering) Whats going on?
 Ross:What?! What?!
 Ross:Actually it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
 Ross:(He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Ross:It’ll be okay Joe.
 Ross:That little naked guy would be me.
 Ross:Yes yes fine that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
 Ross:Got me.
 Ross:Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
 Ross:(looking) Nono that would be me again.
 Ross:(To Chandler) Oh man this is hilarious.
 Ross:(quietly) Dude!
 Ross:Dude! How-how did you write this?
 Ross:You can’t do that!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey uh Mon I saw the Porsche parked out front can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.
 Ross:It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
 Ross:Whew! That was a brisk ride!
 Ross:Only way to fly.
 Ross:You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
 Ross:Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.
 Ross:What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
 Ross:No way!
 Ross:Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter because if I remember correctly there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
 Ross:What do you think you’re doing?!
 Ross:There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?
 Ross:No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)
 Ross:With you?! Yeah right!
 Ross:(grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in but into the back seat.)
 Ross:In the death seat?!!
 Ross:(shocked) You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
 Ross:(grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
 Ross:Okay stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you you are not in that much trouble.
 Ross:I was talking to myself! You’re going down!
 Ross:Yeah I’ll get right on that.
 Ross:No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:Dear Lord!!
 Ross:Here it comes.
 Ross:Well she should it was taken ten years ago!
 Ross:I can handle the stick!!
 Ross:Who?
 Ross:What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
 Ross:Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! (They pull over.)
 Ross:Good evening officer.
 Ross:Ah no. I don’t but it could not have been more than sixty.
 Ross:I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
 Ross:Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…
 Ross:(laughs) You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty?
 Ross:I know. I know.
 Ross:Oh where are you guys going?
 Ross:Ah. Joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?
 Ross:(To Chandler) Y’know what? Actually I’m kinda glad they’re leaving ‘cause uh I need to talk to you about something.
 Ross:Well this uh this may be a little awkward.
 Ross:No its…Its not that. Umm now what I’m going to say to you I’m not saying as your friend. Okay? I’m-I’m saying as it as Monica’s older brother.
 Ross:Not for the next few minutes.
 Ross:Nope.
 Ross:Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn’t be more thrilled for both of you but as Monica’s older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind I will hunt you down and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What? I’m-I’m-I’m serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) Come—Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I’m-I’m not kidding here!
 Ross:No problem.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(walks up) Wow Monica! Hey just so you know I had my uh older brother chat with Chandler.
 Ross:Well I…I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)
 Ross:Thanks you guys. (Walks away happily and his parents smile.)
 Ross:(clinking a wine glass) Can I have everyone’s attention please? I’m uh; I’m Ross Geller.
 Ross:Dad…dad please! As I was saying umm I’m Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh and I’m the best man. And uh this marriage is doubly special for me umm because not only is the groom my best friend but uh the bride is my little sister. And she’s the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you’d all please join me in raising a glass to the the couple we’re here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings.
 Ross:Oh taking my parents back to the hotel.
 Ross:What? Are you going back to work?
 Ross:Nice shades.
 Ross:And if I remember correctly Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
 Ross:Hey where’s Chandler?
 Ross:(going up to Rachel’s closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and looks inside and doesn’t see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still doesn’t find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Is uh is Monica here?
 Ross:I think Chandler’s gone. (He hands her the note.)
 Ross:He left that.
 Ross:I think it means he freaked out and left!
 Ross:Look—Okay I’m just gonna—I’m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out okay?
 Ross:(scared) I will I will find him.
 Ross:Gunther have you uh have you seen Chandler?
 Ross:Oh damn!
 Ross:Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
 Ross:Well then we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks away slowly but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (They’re sitting by the window.) What-what…what you guys doing here?!
 Ross:Why?!
 Ross:(shocked) Gunther?!
 Ross:What? Your-your list?
 Ross:Yes! No-no! I know I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler could you just let him know I’m looking for him?
 Ross:No! I talked to Joey on the set he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!
 Ross:No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure they both think I’m interested in them.
 Ross:No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!
 Ross:Well can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go back to some of the places I went last night.
 Ross:Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
 Ross:Give me two.
 Ross:Okay wish me luck.
 Ross:Why?!
 Ross:We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!
 Ross:That is an old Chinese woman!
 Ross:Aw y’know…Y’know maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?
 Ross:So this is your office?
 Ross:She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know okay? Now come on we’re going home.
 Ross:What’s wrong with being the Bings?
 Ross:Chandler have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
 Ross:Then you are neither of your parents!
 Ross:Y’know okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
 Ross:(interrupting him) Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now that’s not scary right?
 Ross:There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary was it?
 Ross:I’m telling you just a little bit at a time.
 Ross:Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can you can do that too! Just like you’ve done everything else!
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa where where you going?!
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm anyone seen Chandler?
 Ross:He-he was with me umm we’re playing a little game y’know? Hide and seek.
 Ross:(pause) You’re right thanks for keeping me honest dad.
 Ross:Oh my God! Monica!
 Ross:Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.
 Ross:Uh-huh.
 Ross:These-these are beads of joy.
 Ross:Uh Phoebe can I see you for a second?
 Ross:Chandler’s gone again!
 Ross:(turning a corner) There he is!!
 Ross:You’re not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
 Ross:Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) I’m serious! You’re not walking out on my sister!
 Ross:Then where the hell have you been?!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What?! What?! Talking about what?!
 Ross:Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…
 Ross:Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?
 Ross:Dude. (Hugs him.)
 Ross:Huh. This is nice.
 Ross:I’ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can’t end in divorce.
 Ross:Rings?
 Ross:(To Monica) Okay I know I’m not supposed to know but I do. And I’m so excited for you!
 Ross:Monica’s pregnant!
 Ross:What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?
 Ross:No! (Pause) I’ll be right back. (Exits.)
 Ross:Hi. I’m uh I’m Ross. I don’t I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother.
 Ross:Oh! Hello uh Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona wow what a what a beautiful name.
 Ross:Aw come on Mona Lisa?
 Ross:Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
 Ross:Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh uh me too.
 Ross:(sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken.
 Ross:Hey! Uh I thought I thought you were at table six.
 Ross:Oh see before you uh when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh which was misleading. Well I’m… (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.
 Ross:It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.
 Ross:Umm would you like to dance?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
 Ross:I wasn’t farting! (To Mona) Uh a little game from our table. (To the little girl) Yes?
 Ross:Oh umm well uh maybe-maybe later. Right now I’m about to dance with this lady.
 Ross:Uh unless! Unless uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first.
 Ross:Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
 Ross:Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?
 Ross:Keep dancing.
 Ross:No-no thank you Miranda.
 Ross:All right. (Walks over to Mona.)
 Ross:Oh-oh were you were you watching?
 Ross:What? Of course you can! Hop on!
 Ross:I am so gonna score.
 Ross:I like your bow.
 Ross:(to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.
 Ross:No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)
 Ross:Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
 Ross:Oh you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what’s uh what’s your name.
 Ross:That’s that’s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Ross’s feet but he pulls them out of harm’s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
 Ross:Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
 Ross:I’m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
 Ross:Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert’s shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)
 Ross:I just didn’t see the fast song coming.
 Ross:Oh thank you.
 Ross:Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.
 Ross:Thread!
 Ross:What disposable cameras?
 Ross:No you didn’t.
 Ross:Oh-oh yeah you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian? (Chandler laughs.) Yeah then you did that.
 Ross:No. Sorry man.
 Ross:Well I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.
 Ross:In-in three minutes.
 Ross:Chandler?
 Ross:No. Did you?
 Ross:Well I checked in the uh lost and found I talked to the manager no-one’s turned them.
 Ross:Now you guys just got married why is she so depressed?
 Ross:I’m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
 Ross:No-no-no I’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop throw our tuxes back on and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.
 Ross:I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
 Ross:I’m telling you this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?
 Ross:What about the chairs?
 Ross:How about the place settings?
 Ross:What did you do?
 Ross:Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)
 Ross:I heard it. I heard it.
 Ross:Okay. Okay!
 Ross:Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
 Ross:A ’95 LeSabre?!
 Ross:A green LeSabre?
 Ross:I’m sorry I meant a blue LeSabre.
 Ross:Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Now you are going to love these.
 Ross:Huh didn’t see that coming.
 Ross:Well I’m gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.
 Ross:No-no I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month!
 Ross:Hey! How you doing?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Oh hey right back at ya.
 Ross:Yeah. She—Well she’s one crazy lady?
 Ross:(shows Tag his sweater tag) Umm I don’t some Italian guy. Come on read your own label. See you later.
 Ross:He is so weird.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:No why?
 Ross:Oh well I guess I’ll catch up with her later.
 Ross:Oh no.
 Ross:I think I might know what this is about.
 Ross:Yeah. Uh uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
 Ross:Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
 Ross:Well we-we said we’d just do it that one time but but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
 Ross:Why? What-what else could it be?
 Ross:I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?
 Ross:Yeah I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:(quietly confident) I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? (They go inside.) Look uh I know why you’re here.
 Ross:Yeah and to save you from any embarrassment umm I think maybe I should talk first.
 Ross:Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?
 Ross:I mean look that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?
 Ross:Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact I have some time right now.
 Ross:Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
 Ross:I’m good. I’m good.
 Ross:Yeah I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand umm how this happened? We-we used a condom.
 Ross:What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
 Ross:No they don’t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
 Ross:Oh well I may as well have!
 Ross:Freaked out? Hey no I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!
 Ross:No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact (picks up the phone) I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
 Ross:(grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
 Ross:(on phone) Yeah I’ll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to escape.)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Sure.
 Ross:Namaste. (Bows.)
 Ross:Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
 Ross:Look is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
 Ross:Yeah but uh… Okay okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together but there’s something else. (Pause) Rachel’s pregnant.
 Ross:With my child.
 Ross:You already know don’t you?
 Ross:Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.
 Ross:Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
 Ross:But hey in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
 Ross:I gotta go find her.
 Ross:Evidently they do.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Uh we-we need to talk.
 Ross:Please please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
 Ross:What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards Rachel’s feet) really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…
 Ross:Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments the uh the Lamaze classes uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.
 Ross:Well yeah I think we should get married.
 Ross:No because that’s the right thing to do.
 Ross:No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.
 Ross:Come on Rach you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.
 Ross:I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
 Ross:When have you ever?
 Ross:Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
 Ross:I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!
 Ross:But not the husband because evidently she can do this alone.
 Ross:(To Rachel standing by her feet) I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me.
 Ross:Oh my God.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:Pretty amazing huh?
 Ross:What? What?!
 Ross:You-you just said that you did!
 Ross:Oh sure come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh look come here look (rolls the machine closer) it’s-it’s-it’s it’s right there (Points).
 Ross:Do you really?
 Ross:Come on! Come on! Here okay-okay you see this? (Points) This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
 Ross:Sweetie that’s it.
 Ross:You’re welcome.
 Ross:Yeah that’s our baby.
 Ross:Oh hey show them the picture of your uterus.
 Ross:Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
 Ross:Hello!
 Ross:So how was the honeymoon?
 Ross:(glaring at him) Yeah thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)
 Ross:(laughs) Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.
 Ross:The lie you just told.
 Ross:There’s the one!
 Ross:Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.
 Ross:What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
 Ross:Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel just-just drop it.
 Ross:I can show you I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It’s an expression.
 Ross:(entering) Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door!
 Ross:Okay listen I am not a pervert!
 Ross:Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look here’s what happened and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm a personal thing.
 Ross:About…about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn’t had sex in months?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m I’m really uncomfortable talking about.
 Ross:I actually had a topic in mind! I’m I’m kinda going through a dry spell sex wise.
 Ross:Five to be lying six.
 Ross:Well I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
 Ross:Please help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!
 Ross:Really? Well then tell it to me.
 Ross:(sarcastic) I’ll try to control myself.
 Ross:(laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
 Ross:(stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please please you were in Western Europe and?
 Ross:(intently listening) Why?
 Ross:It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
 Ross:Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um yeah I was in Barcelona.
 Ross:Anyway umm so I was um I was hiking…
 Ross:(whines) Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo…
 Ross:Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
 Ross:Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
 Ross:No! No I don’t…don’t want to.
 Ross:I was backpacking across Western Europe.
 Ross:I was just outside Barcelona hiking…
 Ross:It’s been six months! I’m always hot!
 Ross:I’ll try that.
 Ross:Thanks.
 Ross:Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
 Ross:Listen if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.
 Ross:Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? (Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:That’s less embarrassing yes. Yes I was.
 Ross:(voiceover) So when she came in I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
 Ross:What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
 Ross:Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross You’ll show me right?) No!
 Ross:Joey! No!
 Ross:Look it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened but I swear I didn’t even watch it! Anyway here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)
 Ross:Forget it she’s destroying it.
 Ross:Look forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So end of story.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:I don’t want people to see it for your sake.
 Ross:Rachel please…
 Ross:Fine. Fine but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)
 Ross:(on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
 Ross:(on tape) You didn’t do it?
 Ross:(pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
 Ross:(on tape) I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh you and I almost…
 Ross:(on tape) I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.
 Ross:(on tape) So we…we both wanted to.
 Ross:(on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm it probably worked out for the best.
 Ross:And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.
 Ross:Now I’m so happy.
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Yeah. Listen about that the whole uh who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.
 Ross:It was. It was an amazing night.
 Ross:I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.
 Ross:Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.
 Ross:Good luck.
 Ross:Mind if I mute?
 Ross:Oh oh there go the clothes.
 Ross:Six months Rachel six months.
 Ross:Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.
 Ross:Oh nice tan!
 Ross:Ah….
 Ross:I have been working out.
 Ross:Oh that’s not pretty.
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Oh no!
 Ross:Oh no!!
 Ross:No!!
 Ross:No!!!
 Ross:(running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
 Ross:Oh ah I think you know where I want to go.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Yeah!!
 Ross:I’m telling you I like the food!
 Ross:Did that guy just call you Toby?
 Ross:Well why don’t you correct him?
 Ross:Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
 Ross:(laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M your middle name is Muriel!!
 Ross:Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy your parents never gave you a chance did they?
 Ross:(entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!
 Ross:So what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
 Ross:Rach? You wanna come?
 Ross:A date?
 Ross:Why no it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh regular. It’s-it’s uh it’s mundane. It’s actually uh a little dull.
 Ross:A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?
 Ross:You set her up?!
 Ross:Joey what-what were you thinking?!
 Ross:Joey I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?
 Ross:A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
 Ross:Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!
 Ross:Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.
 Ross:A bit of a daredevil are we?
 Ross:Okay. Have a great time you guys.
 Ross:Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the entire sentence.)
 Ross:Books?
 Ross:Well I tell you what. Why don’t we uh why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie we’ll just hang.
 Ross:Hey if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.
 Ross:I just…I have to find out how it went.
 Ross:This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
 Ross:I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
 Ross:I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.
 Ross:It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.
 Ross:No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
 Ross:It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.
 Ross:No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
 Ross:No it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
 Ross:Hello.
 Ross:Well how was the date?
 Ross:Uh-huh. What happened?
 Ross:Ah he didn’t uh take it so well?
 Ross:Oh?
 Ross:He sounds swell.
 Ross:Hey wanna…wanna a little cheering up?
 Ross:Sit down.
 Ross:Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
 Ross:Yeah-ha!
 Ross:I’m sorry about your date.
 Ross:Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
 Ross:You wanna you wanna grab some coffee?
 Ross:Hey I thought I cheered you up.
 Ross:Right. Good night.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh hi!
 Ross:Wow! Uh…how are you?
 Ross:Oh that’s right. Well uh would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
 Ross:Great! Well umm…
 Ross:Sure! Uh let me get it for ya.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Well I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…
 Ross:(exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah I think I will.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:That’s right! He was hitting on her and I got her. I guess the better man won. (To Joey) Please don’t take her from me.
 Ross:(entering) Hey! (He’s wearing a costume as well.)
 Ross:Remember the Russian satellite Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well I’m a potato or a…spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that he’s wearing.) So Sputnik becomes… (They’re still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!
 Ross:No I-I’m not doody.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:You made it!
 Ross:Well I’m a spud…
 Ross:Yes!
 Ross:That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
 Ross:Uh in her defense she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
 Ross:Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!
 Ross:Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
 Ross:Pride.
 Ross:(To Chandler) So you gettin’ tired?
 Ross:Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin’ a little tired though.
 Ross:Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona Mona’s standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
 Ross:Hey at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody.
 Ross:Come on who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’.
 Ross:(celebrating) Oh yeah!
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)
 Ross:I think it’s coming from your bag.
 Ross:So apparently I’m available for lunch.
 Ross:You’re moving?
 Ross:So does-does Joey know you’re moving?
 Ross:That’s not really porn.
 Ross:Hey y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
 Ross:Well I don’t know but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel looks at him.) With your permission.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Yeah. No. No you’re right.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.
 Ross:I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh thank God!
 Ross:Of course! Uh yeah she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)
 Ross:Y’know I would it’s just painful.
 Ross:Thanks for the coffee or bedankt voor de koffie Gunter. (He translates that phrase into Dutch.)
 Ross:Yeah we’re done.
 Ross:Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
 Ross:Really?!
 Ross:Sweet!
 Ross:Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
 Ross:No-no I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
 Ross:It’s not for me it’s for Rachel.
 Ross:Yeah but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.
 Ross:Yeah you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?
 Ross:(finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!
 Ross:Damnit!
 Ross:Hi. How is she?
 Ross:(happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh I brought her some bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)
 Ross:Oh I don’t know that it would.
 Ross:All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
 Ross:Well the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!
 Ross:(stutters looking for words) Ezels!!
 Ross:Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
 Ross:Yeah a lot of my students do that.
 Ross:Okay I-I’ll see you tonight.
 Ross:Okay bye.
 Ross:Ah it’s good. It’s going good. I mean we get along great. She’s she’s so…
 Ross:Well I was gonna say sweet but yeah-huh!
 Ross:Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off y’know?
 Ross:Sure one year is paper but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his agreement.)
 Ross:Uh actually sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.
 Ross:Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
 Ross:So much more.
 Ross:Aw forget it it’s from Pier One. (There’s an angry knock on the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)
 Ross:Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
 Ross:Who did?!
 Ross:Yes. Yes yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
 Ross:No! No sir umm she means a lot to me. I mean I care—I-I love Rachel.
 Ross:(to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a like a friend.
 Ross:(to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!
 Ross:(To Mona) But I didn’t want to.
 Ross:I’m sorry. Dr. Green Mona. Mona Dr. Green.
 Ross:I was going to tell you but…
 Ross:Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The phone rings and Ross goes to answer it only he’s trapped behind the apothecary table by Dr. Green.) Can I just… (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don’t we just let the machine get that?
 Ross:No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to I need to lie down.
 Ross:So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!
 Ross:I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!
 Ross:Rachel!
 Ross:Okay!
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:Thank you so much for coming back over.
 Ross:Focus.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Trying to date this woman.
 Ross:Probably shouldn’t touch me.
 Ross:Should I leave this open for you too?
 Ross:Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
 Ross:I know and I was going to but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake but it’s only because I really really like you. Really!
 Ross:(entering) Will!
 Ross:Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?
 Ross:Yeah you too. Man so-so what are you up to?
 Ross:Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
 Ross:Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh Lance Davis’ graduation party.
 Ross:Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in but still real fun.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(laughs) Yeah.
 Ross:So how long are you in town?
 Ross:Aw—oh that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
 Ross:Will high school was-was a long time ago.
 Ross:No need to point she knows who Ross is.
 Ross:No. No.
 Ross:Uh actually there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.
 Ross:That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.
 Ross:Look Rach I-I’m sorry okay? I…I was a stupid kid okay? The only reason I joined…
 Ross:…co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
 Ross:No-no! No-no. No-no.
 Ross:It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
 Ross:Actually Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.
 Ross:Rach I think you’re reading a little too much into it.
 Ross:Look what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!
 Ross:Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Hey! She didn’t look 50!
 Ross:She didn’t photograph well!
 Ross:I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…
 Ross:Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in the club!
 Ross:As a romancer of the elderly.
 Ross:The eyes…did still sparkle.
 Ross:Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Nope.
 Ross:That’s right I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.
 Ross:Bye.
 Ross:Yeah. Why?
 Ross:Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.
 Ross:Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
 Ross:What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
 Ross:Uh I actually haven’t even met him.
 Ross:Well actually I’m picking Ben up tomorrow maybe he’ll be there.
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…
 Ross:I dropped him off at Carol’s. (To Phoebe) Anyway it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.
 Ross:Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.
 Ross:Apparently Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.
 Ross:Phoebe you can’t force kids to be friends.
 Ross:Playpen?! Ben’s seven!
 Ross:Look I’m sorry Pheebs I can’t do it.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Look Phoebe I’m sorry it’s just…
 Ross:Phoebe I…
 Ross:You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)
 Ross:Well…let’s just say… (singing) Rosss caaaaan!
 Ross:Uh middle balcony.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Oh great! Hey-hey Joey do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
 Ross:Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
 Ross:Wow! That is a good one! Wow it looks like a like a holiday card y’know with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
 Ross:(pause) Together? Like-like to people?
 Ross:Okay. (Not happy about it.)
 Ross:Uh sure sure.
 Ross:I know. Can you believe that?
 Ross:Married couples send out cards families send out cards people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Huh. Wow this is great.
 Ross:Well we-we haven’t said that to each other yet but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
 Ross:A hundred?! Well I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh card thing.
 Ross:Sending out a holiday card together I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Huh.
 Ross:Hmm…
 Ross:Let’s do the card!
 Ross:The card! I think we’re there!
 Ross:Really?! I mean even with the card?
 Ross:(entering) Hey!
 Ross:Oh yeah yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!
 Ross:Yeah we’re not just doing a card! Y’know she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
 Ross:I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman So where is this going?
 Ross:Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.
 Ross:Smaller than that.
 Ross:Uh bigger than that.
 Ross:Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
 Ross:Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet but I could say I looove spending time with you.
 Ross:Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
 Ross:Here we go. Mona umm I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
 Ross:Aw we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more but decides there isn’t.)
 Ross:I mean there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you not you you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?
 Ross:Well well to sum up we’re having fun you look young.
 Ross:But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment. (Hands her his key.)
 Ross:Really.
 Ross:Not just a key I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
 Ross:Oh great I live on the street.
 Ross:Okay and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
 Ross:No. That guy is.
 Ross:I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
 Ross:I love you!
 Ross:Hey! Oh I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
 Ross:Professor Neuman the head of the department so….
 Ross:No I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn’t I get head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)
 Ross:…which brings us back of course to Greely’s theory of dominance. (The bell rings.) Okay that-that’s all for today. Oh uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
 Ross:What?! That-that’s all the way cross town I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
 Ross:Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!
 Ross:Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I’m sorry I’m a little late. Ah—(Checks his watch)—Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh by introducing myself I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up I’m Professor Geller. Good job today.
 Ross:No I ran. It was really far and when did people stop understanding the phrase Get the hell out of my way!
 Ross:Ugh between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides I teach the class three times a week who am I? Rockefeller?
 Ross:Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.
 Ross:You’ve seen it the Geller Yeller.
 Ross:Besides I-I think I figured out a much faster route I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)
 Ross:Yeah!!!! Yes I made it! I’m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a student takes a drink and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay why don’t we all uh (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where… (Exhales again) Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay (Closes his book.) umm why don’t why don’t you all start to read while I—(Passes out and collapses.)
 Ross:Phoebe!!
 Ross:So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time he’s wearing in-line skates and hasn’t taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map somewhere in the Middle East then spins on the skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs…
 Ross:Right.
 Ross:No-no we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.
 Ross:And smart!
 Ross:With an aptitude for science.
 Ross:Really? Me too!
 Ross:Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup you know? Uh Rach-Rach what were you thinking? (Gives her a look)
 Ross:Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
 Ross:Well OK it’s for a boy. Well I know it’s a little out there but…Darwin.
 Ross:You’re just saying that cause I said no to your name!
 Ross:All right.
 Ross:That sounds fair.
 Ross:Veto.
 Ross:Rain? Hi. Hi my name is Rain. I have my own kiln and my dress is made out of wheat.
 Ross:Okay how about for a guy Thatcher?
 Ross:Fine you go.
 Ross:Huh.
 Ross:Oh veto. How about—Ooh I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
 Ross:Veto. Stewart?
 Ross:Veto. Helen?
 Ross:I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean come on little Ruthie Geller how-how cute is that?
 Ross:Uh no. No we’re not.
 Ross:No no we want to wait right?
 Ross:What? Rach! Come on that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.
 Ross:Yeah why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it. (Rachel starts to peek at the file) Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!
 Ross:You’re looking!
 Ross:I saw you!
 Ross:Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
 Ross:No no no no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!
 Ross:Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Rach I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!
 Ross:I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
 Ross:Veto.
 Ross:Unless… (Rachel groans.) You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
 Ross:Not like this!
 Ross:So I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
 Ross:That’s right. The student has become the master.
 Ross:Oh come on you know it’s a girl!
 Ross:You really didn’t know?
 Ross:No.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
 Ross:I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!
 Ross:Permission to veto.
 Ross:(from outside the bathroom) Hello?
 Ross:(entering) Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh cool boat—(Sees why the boat’s there)—Oh no. (Averts his eyes by looking around the room) (To Rachel) Hey did you did you tell them?
 Ross:(crying) I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!! (Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachel’s belly.)
 Ross:Hey when-when was it kicking? What happened?
 Ross:My God the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.
 Ross:Look I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
 Ross:(rushes in) Is everything okay?
 Ross:Your page said come to the hospital what? What was it? What happened?
 Ross:Oh. Oh. Thank God most women don’t even feel them.
 Ross:Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
 Ross:No I—Mona!
 Ross:What? Why? What’s wrong?
 Ross:No really you tell me what’s up.
 Ross:(To Joey) So thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
 Ross:Yeah but still I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.
 Ross:Hey uh I brought you some lunch.
 Ross:Well yeah!
 Ross:What?! What?! Rach what?!
 Ross:I made her favorite tuna salad with pickles.
 Ross:(to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?
 Ross:I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!
 Ross:Yeah? Not to you because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
 Ross:So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
 Ross:No! No it’s not. Joey this is a smart idea.
 Ross:Really?
 Ross:Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)
 Ross:Oh I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah she’s been away all week visiting her parents but she’ll be cool. I mean she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says ‘Fossils are my friends.’
 Ross:Uh I’m going to take off.
 Ross:What is it?
 Ross:All right. (reading the label) ‘Candy and Cookie?’
 Ross:Hey what’s behind your back?
 Ross:You don’t want my opinion?
 Ross:Come on I’m your older brother ask me!
 Ross:(quietly) The red one.
 Ross:Hey! (they hug) So how was Atlantic City?
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Wha—? Oh come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?! (Mona laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know most people think this is made with sea water but it’s actually made with uh salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.
 Ross:I do too! I missed you!
 Ross:Oh it was good! It was good. Actually the baby started kicking!
 Ross:Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.
 Ross:Yeah I’m missing out on all this other stuff too. So Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:(not amused) Huh…uh-huh.
 Ross:(with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs but turns his head and starts to break down)
 Ross:I don’t know she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um plus she uh she got me taffy!
 Ross:Ever?!
 Ross:Oh no no no I will! I just want to butter her up first! You know I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff and then just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
 Ross:Well I’m uh going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
 Ross:Y’know it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater when in fact—
 Ross:(opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m um supposed to pick you up!
 Ross:(he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like…)Ayyyayyyy!
 Ross:I have no idea!
 Ross:Uh…lately she just likes hanging out here.
 Ross:I think she’s lonely.
 Ross:I know.
 Ross:No no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
 Ross:Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional but but ballsy.
 Ross:And you thought she was going to be in our way! So why don’t you uh open the champagne and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.
 Ross:(fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)
 Ross:(handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.
 Ross:Hey hey man!
 Ross:Uh…Mona just dumped me.
 Ross:Well with everything that’s been going on lately I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know I uh I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner you know?
 Ross:Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on huh? Girl trouble?
 Ross:Really?!
 Ross:Oh sorry. Well look maybe I can help you with it.
 Ross:Hey whatever it is I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know actually once—once I got dumped during sex.
 Ross:Anyway so uh so what is it?
 Ross:C’mon! Joey! What is it?
 Ross:Hey hey it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?
 Ross:She’s not a Tribbiani?
 Ross:I knew it. So is she someone from work?
 Ross:Well uh does she like you?
 Ross:Why not?
 Ross:So uh this guy she used to go out with is uh… is he still in love with her?
 Ross:Okay. Um… is he a good guy?
 Ross:Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
 Ross:Joey it’s worth finding out. I mean if you really like her.
 Ross:Okay Joey you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you huh? You owe it to yourself.
 Ross:I’m going to…uh…I’m going to um put the bourbon in it at home.
 Ross:Anyway… seriously uh…just…just talk to the guy okay? And tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until…)
 Ross:So uh this guy she used to go out with is uh… is he a good guy?
 Ross:Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
 Ross:Joey it’s worth finding out. I mean if you really like her.
 Ross:Okay Joey you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until…)
 Ross:(closes the door) Did you um—I’m sorry did you just say it’s Rachel?
 Ross:Um you…you like Rachel?
 Ross:Rachel?!
 Ross:But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
 Ross:It’s not a big deal? Oh I’m sorry I just…um I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?
 Ross:Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
 Ross:Y’know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
 Ross:(stops) I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Oh y’know I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out only weirder!
 Ross:Oh my God! What if what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
 Ross:Sure because women never like Joey. Y’know I think he’s a virgin.
 Ross:He’s not?
 Ross:Why?
 Ross:Hate him? I… No I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s just it’s Rachel y’know?
 Ross:Okay. Okay I’ll talk to him.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:No I don’t want to hit you.
 Ross:No.
 Ross:No no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)
 Ross:Uh…yeah sure. (Enters.)
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:What?! You’re in love with her.
 Ross:Umm no.
 Ross:I think you need to tell her how you feel.
 Ross:No I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is because if she’s not where you are then you can start to move past this.
 Ross:If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
 Ross:Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
 Ross:So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
 Ross:I’m understanding but let’s not get carried away.
 Ross:Yeah tell me about it. (He stands up turns his back to Joey and enjoys another sip.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down like a like a faded salmon?
 Ross:Faded salmon color.
 Ross:Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!
 Ross:That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
 Ross:I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up jump up my own ass and die. (Walks away.)
 Ross:Mona? (There’s no answer so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay if I were a salmon shirt where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
 Ross:Hello!!
 Ross:Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
 Ross:(on phone) Item J437-A color winterberry. (There’s a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm listen come here come in. (She does so.) I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’s just that I… (He picks up the pink shirt.)
 Ross:You do?
 Ross:(faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right.
 Ross:(laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
 Ross:Sure. Yeah.
 Ross:Uh yeah you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
 Ross:Okay hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Aww that is so cool.
 Ross:(picking up Chi-Chi’s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
 Ross:You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
 Ross:Ah actually I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.
 Ross:Well there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.
 Ross:So uh he seems like a nice guy.
 Ross:Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
 Ross:Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
 Ross:That’s a good question dad. That’s a good question…
 Ross:Wha—What?
 Ross:Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?
 Ross:Can you believe that?
 Ross:No us having to lie about being married.
 Ross:Hi Aunt Lisa Uncle Dan
 Ross:We love marriage!
 Ross:Hey
 Ross:I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?
 Ross:(imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry…(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
 Ross:That depends how much did you hear?
 Ross:What was wrong with Mona?
 Ross:Yeah baby!
 Ross:No no it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
 Ross:Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side) Umm…. what are you doing?
 Ross:Okay okay. Ooooh ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
 Ross:Well um actually I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies her favorite flower…
 Ross:Then Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words Will you marry me?
 Ross:Oh no Mom it’s just Monica this year.
 Ross:No of course Um… Um everybody? Um I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride Rachel (She turns around and smiles) and myself. Umm that if…if in 35 years we’re half as happy as you guys are we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
 Ross:…and then we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
 Ross:But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?
 Ross:Yeah! And! And it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:I know I know it was stupid.
 Ross:No actually I thought about it when when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh I would ask you to marry me.
 Ross:It’s a good thing I didn’t do it because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay good night
 Ross:Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?
 Ross:That’s all I’m askin’
 Ross:Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.
 Ross:Hey! All that stuff you said about true love you were right I mean we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Why’d you say no?
 Ross:Just then or-or all the time ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.
 Ross:Shhh! We’re not talking.
 Ross:Uh double latte extra foam.
 Ross:(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on its fun!
 Ross:Are you serious?!
 Ross:Wow! We are pretty good at this!
 Ross:Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
 Ross:It tastes like feet!
 Ross:Are you kidding?
 Ross:(leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
 Ross:Yeah so far nothing stupid.
 Ross:Uh no no just-just that he is a great guy.
 Ross:Yeah you too.
 Ross:All right Ive been feeling incredibly guilty about this because I wanna be a good friend and damnit I am a good friend. So just just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).
 Ross:Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
 Ross:Your make-up!
 Ross:Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
 Ross:I would say that.
 Ross:Okay here I go.
 Ross:I prefer not to answer that right now I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
 Ross:It really was.
 Ross:Hi Jill.
 Ross:Amazing! Amazing!
 Ross:Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
 Ross:Did you just wink at me?
 Ross:Oh cool!
 Ross:Well do you want some help?
 Ross:Awesome!
 Ross:(simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!
 Ross:Well uh I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh…
 Ross:I’m sorry I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
 Ross:The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh I’ll take another question.
 Ross:It’s okay I’m ready.
 Ross:(exhaling) The fear of Triscuts!
 Ross:It’s possible they have really sharp edges.
 Ross:Wait a minute I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
 Ross:Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:(To Chandler) You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…
 Ross:(excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler) Haaa! (To Joey) I’d like a Wicked Wango card!
 Ross:(thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay I know this give me-give me a second!
 Ross:Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
 Ross:I’d like to spin the wheel!
 Ross:Is there a hopping bonus?
 Ross:Ben Franklin.
 Ross:Queen Victoria.
 Ross:Noooo!!! Every time!!!
 Ross:Yeah!!
 Ross:(entering out of breath) Hey!
 Ross:I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
 Ross:Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
 Ross:(excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
 Ross:Uh what?
 Ross:What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.
 Ross:Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
 Ross:Well we…we don’t have a garage.
 Ross:Y’know what? Maybe Mrs. Green it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.
 Ross:I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.
 Ross:Well uh y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time by myself.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:That’s a different issue. Uh the point is when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
 Ross:Yes! Yes you’re gonna be so missed.
 Ross:Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)
 Ross:Oh come on every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn’t believe that.) Hey! You will! Uh look y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?
 Ross:Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.
 Ross:I’m telling you.
 Ross:Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
 Ross:You sure?
 Ross:All right then. (Gets up in an announcer’s voice) Rachel Green! Let’s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
 Ross:Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
 Ross:That’s correct! This is an audio question what do you do when the baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
 Ross:Excellent! Excellent now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
 Ross:Oh I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I’ve lost sight of why we’re doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)
 Ross:Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the table.)
 Ross:No Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all gasp.) I didn’t want her to see it so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)
 Ross:Umm…
 Ross:But the good news is no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
 Ross:Yeah they all know.
 Ross:(startling him) What?! What?
 Ross:Are ya?
 Ross:What are you doing up?
 Ross:Okay look I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…
 Ross:It’s funny you should mention diapers.
 Ross:Okay look there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
 Ross:(interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh if you’re gonna do this then I’m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So… (Starts for the bathroom.)
 Ross:(annoyed) Yeah!
 Ross:(stunned) (thinks) Well uh…
 Ross:Oh.
 Ross:We are having a baby together but we’re not involved. (The cashier a very beautiful woman looks confused) I mean uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at him angrily) Or yes stranger we’d like this delivered please.
 Ross:Oh okay.
 Ross:I chose those I’m a paleontologist.
 Ross:Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
 Ross:That’s my gym.
 Ross:I am like Indiana Jones.
 Ross:My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answers it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh what are you doing here?
 Ross:Ah must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
 Ross:Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
 Ross:Oh! Wow! Uh yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (The money) back in my pocket pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah actually I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…
 Ross:(To Katie) Yeah I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh and my whip. (Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not because I’m-I’m into S&M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’m not-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is uncomfortable.) So I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so leaving Katie and Rachel alone.)
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:How are you?
 Ross:Uhh it was fun. We we just had coffee.
 Ross:What’s uh what’s going on? Do you not do you not like Katie?
 Ross:I liked her.
 Ross:Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
 Ross:Why? What was wrong with her?
 Ross:Okay so what’s the matter?
 Ross:(laughs) Why? What what are you jealous?
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:I won’t date. I’ll uh I’ll be here with you all the time.
 Ross:True but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.
 Ross:Do you feel better?
 Ross:Uh Rach?
 Ross:Just one thing umm…
 Ross:We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?
 Ross:Oh-oh Rach! I was just messin’ around! (She’s stunned) Like you did last night when I had to pee?
 Ross:(pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…
 Ross:…that you actually…
 Ross:Rach?
 Ross:The bathroom?
 Ross:Hey! What are you guys looking at?
 Ross:Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
 Ross:Now I cannot wait to see this.
 Ross:Uh sweetie maybe you’d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the green armchair.)
 Ross:Look I-I know how miserable you are I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it’s the male they carry the babies. And then also umm I’d be far away in the sea. (He sits back down.)
 Ross:(entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
 Ross:Rach we gotta go.
 Ross:People ask me why we’re not together I just don’t know what to tell them.
 Ross:Uh do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us but if you hurry…
 Ross:Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. (She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
 Ross:Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Uh-huh.
 Ross:Mmm?
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.
 Ross:Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon why don’t we not speak until then.
 Ross:Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!
 Ross:(to Rachel) Oh you’re nice to her.
 Ross:Do them!!
 Ross:You’ve got to be kidding me!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Yeah we tried them all. We went for a walk uh we tried a special tea caster oil spicy food nothing has worked.
 Ross:It’s sex.
 Ross:Monica!
 Ross:Monica what is the matter with you?
 Ross:What?! While she’s been going through this hell you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Can I get some of that action?
 Ross:Come on finish your enchilada.
 Ross:Okay here have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot! (Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
 Ross:Stop it.
 Ross:I’m sorry but we have to have some boundaries! My God I’m dying.
 Ross:This is insane I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.
 Ross:Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.
 Ross:I love when you talk dirty to me.
 Ross:Okay enough! This is this is not going to happen.
 Ross:Y’know what?
 Ross:Forget it.
 Ross:I’m getting that baby out of you!
 Ross:Oh I know.
 Ross:I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:We’re having a baby.
 Ross:Not so much.
 Ross:All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
 Ross:No but come on we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast but this has got to be some kind of a record!
 Ross:Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
 Ross:N… No! We took a cab too but I did test runs!
 Ross:Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
 Ross:Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi this is Rachel Green. I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:I really think they’re out of rooms.
 Ross:Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble you don’t know where any countries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by Rachel.) Uh say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?
 Ross:What-what?
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:Yeah guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He’s looking at the stirrups on the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his legs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.
 Ross:Hi! Hi I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.
 Ross:Hi Julie.
 Ross:This is Rachel. (Points at her.)
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Umm say I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.
 Ross:Oh okay.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh. Okay just breathe.
 Ross:(simultaneously as Rachel) We’re not gonna do that.
 Ross:Uh yes! Thank you.
 Ross:Later.
 Ross:Oh uh I’m sorry. (Runs out.)
 Ross:Hi! I’m so glad you’re here but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.
 Ross:Oh good.
 Ross:Okay what’s up?
 Ross:Ma you’re asking me to marry you?
 Ross:Mom no come on! Thank you.
 Ross:N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant okay?
 Ross:Mom y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…
 Ross:Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters the hallway.)
 Ross:…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.
 Ross:Are you kidding? Look we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?
 Ross:Okay stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
 Ross:(To Rachel) Hey. Who’s that?
 Ross:What happened to the Disgustingtons?
 Ross:Wow! Sorry. So uh how are the new people?
 Ross:Yeah? Okay.
 Ross:Umm. Umm I’m-I’m just gonna—(Closes the privacy screen.)
 Ross:No-no I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)
 Ross:Just ignore them.
 Ross:What? What?
 Ross:(to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
 Ross:The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.
 Ross:That’s it. That’s it.
 Ross:Just three?! I’m dilated three!
 Ross:Actually it’s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)
 Ross:Uh Rach…
 Ross:And yet somehow it’s true!
 Ross:(To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
 Ross:(softly) Really?
 Ross:Oh there you go!
 Ross:No-no. We…
 Ross:Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh uh that’s all.
 Ross:Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place y’know? But we’re very excited about this.
 Ross:Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Not just Janice Janice in labor contracting and everything.
 Ross:Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
 Ross:Sweetie you’re doing great.
 Ross:What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!
 Ross:What is that?
 Ross:Oh thank God I thought she had two heads.
 Ross:Go!
 Ross:Yes you can!
 Ross:Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!
 Ross:No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready? 1…2…3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking him down.)
 Ross:(from the floor) Keep pushing!
 Ross:You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!
 Ross:Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!
 Ross:Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.
 Ross:Oh she’s…she’s perfect.
 Ross:Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.
 Ross:Oh come in.
 Ross:The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus you-you’re sleep deprived.
 Ross:Uh actually we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.
 Ross:Wow! Umm okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel starts crying.) What?
 Ross:Umm Delilah.
 Ross:So I guess we’re back to uh Baby Girl.
 Ross:Ugh easy for you to say you already know what your kids names are going to be.
 Ross:(entering) Hey Janice!
 Ross:Who’s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)
 Ross:No-no. No.
 Ross:Okay.
 Ross:Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:Yeah. Yeah it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again y’know?
 Ross:I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?
 Ross:Oh my God! I’m sorry I was talking to this nurse completely forgot.
 Ross:Yeah. She’s putting her down now that’s her. (Points to the nurse putting Emma now.)
 Ross:Look at Emma!
 Ross:Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous it’s all Rachel.
 Ross:It’s…it’s complicated okay?
 Ross:Look we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart and then together and then apart and now we have a baby. (Pause) It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything—(Starts to cry.) Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really we’re doing really well right now.
 Ross:Yeah exactly.
 Ross:Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.
 Ross:You’re weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.) (To Rachel) Listen I uh wanted to talk to you about something.
 Ross:Uh Joey can you give us just a minute?
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Hey where’s uh where’s mom?
 Ross:Uh Dad Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.
 Ross:What about Ben?
 Ross:Oh well yeah actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
 Ross:Yeah right.
 Ross:What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
 Ross:Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!
 Ross:I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
 Ross:(noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s head to look at Emma.)
 Ross:Wow! Kind of uh kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)
 Ross:Dad what are you doing?
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:What that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Phoebe there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.
 Ross:(pause) I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
 Ross:No! No come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.
 Ross:What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!
 Ross:I didn’t give her that ring!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:It’s mine.
 Ross:Yes!
 Ross:No!
 Ross:No!!
 Ross:Look. Look my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.
 Ross:Look I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket assume that I was going to propose throw it on and-and just start telling people?
 Ross:Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause) Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Listen I um… I heard about the engagement.
 Ross:And confused. Rach sweetie I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.
 Ross:I don’t think you do.
 Ross:Poor baby you’re so tired. Rach I didn’t propose to you Joey didn’t propose to you and Chandler didn’t propose to you.
 Ross:Joey proposed to you?
 Ross:Hey wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey did you propose to her?
 Ross:Wait! Whoa-whoa you…you gave her the ring?
 Ross:Whoa! You were down on one knee?
 Ross:Then what did happen?
 Ross:Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa you saw her breast?!
 Ross:What?!
 Ross:Uhh… No.
 Ross:But I-I was going to see if y’know maybe you uh start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all Rach.
 Ross:No you didn’t!
 Ross:(To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!
 Ross:Hey I’m not going to rush into anything!
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
 Ross:Good weird?
 Ross:We’re so lucky.
 Ross:Look I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Okay well that… Wow okay well umm…then maybe at least we can we can talk about us again.
 Ross:Well good okay. I-I kind of think y’know if we…if… You’re wearing the ring.
 Ross:And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
 Ross:When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?
 Ross:You said you’d marry Joey?
 Ross:So you said yes to him and you just had our baby?
 Ross:So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again you were engaged to my best friend.
 Ross:Well Chandler’s my oldest friend but Joey’s my—No! Ah! (points at Rachel)
 Ross:Rachel said she’d marry you?!
 Ross:(enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
 Ross:In the closet.
 Ross:Linen closet.
 Ross:In the hospital.
 Ross:No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.
 Ross:Sure what kind?
 Ross:Please take your time it’s an important decision. Not like say I know! deciding to marry someone this is about a muffin.
 Ross:Blueberry it is.
 Ross:Hey Gunther can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)
 Ross:Yep.
 Ross:Yep can you believe it?
 Ross:Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a… Huh?
 Ross:Ah actually we don’t. (Ross walks off)
 Ross:(turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!
 Ross:Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) accidentally picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again) accidentally proposed to Rachel.
 Ross:And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel but why couldn’t you tell me huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.
 Ross:Not using it right Joe.
 Ross:I’m gonna go.
 Ross:Give me the bag.

 Ross:No!
 Ross:You ducked!!
 Ross:Oh my god this really hurts!!!
 Ross:What is the matter with you?!?
 Ross:Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
 Ross:I broke my thumb.
 Ross:You know what you can go I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but can’t)
 Ross:Why does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)
 Ross:Just Ross!
 Ross:You know my birthday.
 Ross:October 18th.
 Ross:Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
 Ross:Ah Rachel I guess.
 Ross:Just ah… just put roommate.
 Ross:I don’t think that we are.
 Ross:Well I thought so too but then she said she’d marry you.
 Ross:Yeah that’s what she said.
 Ross:So I don’t wanna be just anybody.
 Ross:You know what it’s it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Yes. I mean it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a plan you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello? (Pause) I’m fine.
 Ross:Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:Ah I had a little thing with Joey if you think this is bad you should see him.
 Ross:Okay.

 Ross:Rach you cant call people at three in the morning.
 Ross:Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
 Ross:Well what was it?
 Ross:Rach I told you you cant call him every time any little thing comes up.
 Ross:Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know I dont think thats a good idea. In fact I think hes dead.
 Ross:Rach I promise first thing tomorrow well find another doctor but I gotta get up early and Im not feeling all that well.
 Ross:You know? Come to think of it it does feel Rubella-like! (Walks back into his room.)
 Ross:(Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!
 Ross:Thanks doctor.

 Ross:I know it�s the first time we�re leaving the baby and � hey I know how hard it is for you but � but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She�s great with kids.
 Ross:Ya.
 Ross:Hey you only heard Monica�s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
 Ross:Rachel I know that you can. And you should.
 Ross:Really it would be good for you and in fact why don�t you why don�t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I�ll meet you there.
 Ross:No no really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)
 Ross:I�m serious. C�mon you should go. Here. (shoves her outside while she tries to stay) No uh-uh just go.
 Ross:No! No you know what? (closes the door) You [can�t get in there] (?) the baby�s fine now squam (?). Yeah [I told you a|Tell your] story walking. (?)
 Ross:Oh (door is locked) holy molly are we in a pickle now.
 Ross:Okay well the ??? is not home.
 Ross:Oh-oh wait my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
 Ross:I would but I bruise like a peach. Besides y�you know everything is gonna be fine. The baby�s sleeping.
 Ross:Can�t hold her own head up but yeah jumped.
 Ross:Rach you did not leave the water running. Please just pull yourself together okay?
 Ross:You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in �609 - TOW Ross Got High� first aired 1999-11-25.)
 Ross:Oh my god you know what yeah I think you�re right. I think � listen listen!
 Ross:A pigeon a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No no wait no-no an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby seeing this jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird�s aid. The eagle however misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip swirling around the whirl pool that fills the apartment.
 Ross:Great. So let�s get going?
 Ross:Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
 Ross:I�m so sorry �
 Ross:And then Rachel wasn�t sure she could leave the baby.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Thanks. Oh.
 Ross:Y�know this ??? is incredible.
 Ross:Okay I�ll have the fixed salad and the duck.
 Ross:Rach c�mon Emma is fine. You�re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay you need to stop.
 Ross:(childish) Huh-huh they already know it.
 Ross:W-oa � Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
 Ross:Well ??? think that�s us?
 Ross:You know I think that�s a good idea�our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye y�guys.
 Ross:Thank you.
 Ross:Boy we uhm... hadnt really thought of that.
 Ross:Oh come on Rach we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
 Ross:She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while but then gets a gotcha expression on his face... Theres knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay okay. This ones name is Sandy. Shes got a degree in early childhood education uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
 Ross:And shes a little mannish...
 Ross:Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)
 Ross:(skeptic) So youre just like a... guy whos a nanny?
 Ross:(on a yeah right tone) Okay.
 Ross:Yeah kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)
 Ross:Oh come on Rach hes a guy!
 Ross:Because its weird!
 Ross:What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-Its like if a woman wanted to be...
 Ross:King?
 Ross:You gotta be at least bi...
 Ross:(very worried) Is everything allright?
 Ross:And Im fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a why do you say that manner) Rach can I... can I see you for a sec?
 Ross:Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I havent cried that many times since I moved in.
 Ross:(picks up a cookie) Okay okay see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
 Ross:(speaking with his mouth full) Yeah I mean all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!
 Ross:This... this is exactly what Im talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies huh? Theyre not even... butch manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)
 Ross:Hey... theres sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
 Ross:Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
 Ross:Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
 Ross:(looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But thats not the point. (Joey now also enters)
 Ross:Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:...a what? A what? Whats the end of that sentence?
 Ross:Wow!
 Ross:Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
 Ross:Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like Can you believe that?)
 Ross:Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross What are you doing?)
 Ross:Yep! Thats my thing...
 Ross:Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
 Ross:(looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)
 Ross:Okay okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
 Ross:(shakes his head) Oh my God!
 Ross:Oh Im sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
 Ross:Well you know what... I-Im sorry Im the only one who isnt in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I cant... I cant go through with this.
 Ross:No! Hey you know what? Im sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
 Ross:Thank you!
 Ross:Here goes...
 Ross:Sandy... Hi we uhm... we kinda need to talk. Im afraid its not working out.
 Ross:Yeah uhm... I mean Rachel and I think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
 Ross:I... just feel that the... the chemistry isnt right. Im sorry. Were... were more than happy to give you good recommendation...
 Ross:Anyway uhm...Well Im glad theres no hard feelings.
 Ross:No you know its uhm... nothing you did its... its uhm... my issue.
 Ross:You know Im just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy whos as sensitive as you.
 Ross:Why... I... I dont know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
 Ross:I mean uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasnt the athlete I am now.
 Ross:I play squash...! Anyway uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
 Ross:It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... What are you doing with those things? Whats wrong with you why arent you... why arent you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
 Ross:I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when its summer and its hot why cant you wear a tank top?
 Ross:Here come some more...
 Ross:And thats why no matter what mommy says we really were on a break. (baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! Youre just a... a little bitty baby you know that? But youve got... (in a softer voice) Youve got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the Bs) Big baby butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers cant deny / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist / and a round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God Emma... youre laughing! Oh my God youve never done that before have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh huh? Well daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda dont want none / unless you got buns hon... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks worried) Im a terrible father!
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
 Ross:Yeah and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emmas laugh but it comes out very squeaky very high pitched. He laughs about himself but then looks at Rachel realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) Only... only not creepy.
 Ross:I uhm... Well I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachels face changes from excited to angry)
 Ross:But you know what if you think about it it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
 Ross:Please dont take her away from me!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh I know isnt it? Ooh... whatd you do to get her to laugh?
 Ross:You sang Baby Got Back didnt you?
 Ross:She sweat wet. got it going like a turbo vette.
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Hell yeah!
 Ross:Shake it!
 Ross:Shake it!
 Ross:Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees their friends standing in the doorway)
 Ross:Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
 Ross:A lot of people are thankful for those.
 Ross:Hey Amy.
 Ross:That was me.
 Ross:Sure we dont live there but...
 Ross:I know I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
 Ross:Dont say that.
 Ross:Sure you want to go upstairs?
 Ross:You know I think thats a great idea. Itll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
 Ross:Ok fine but I dont want them bonding to much. I dont want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
 Ross:Emma.
 Ross:Well we havent offically asked them yet but we would want Monica and Chandler.
 Ross:well.. its just. its just in that case then um. Emma would go to my parents.
 Ross:Yeah and wed want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
 Ross:No you both are equally capable. Its just.. youre strongest when.. when youre together.
 Ross:Sure Monica would have to give her up.
 Ross:Hey dude you okay? Sorry about before.
 Ross:Emma.
 Ross:Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
 Ross:So so now do I get Joey?
 Ross:Youre really not coming back?
 Ross:I cant get *enough* dinosaurs!
 Ross:You got me a cola drink?
 Ross:Well this this is too much I feel like I should get you another sweater.
 Ross:Ooh hey Ben what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
 Ross:Yeah!
 Ross:Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
 Ross:What are you doing here Santa?
 Ross:Im the Holiday Armadillo your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
 Ross:(to Chandler) What are you doing?
 Ross:Thank you but but you you gotta leave.
 Ross:Because Im finally getting him excited about Hanukkah and and youre-youre wrecking it.
 Ross:Im sorry Chandler but this this is really important to me.
 Ross:(in a low voice) Answer faster answer faster!
 Ross:(in the same low voice) Answer better answer better!
 Ross:Really? Youre not gonna return it?
 Ross:Wow it really is!
 Ross:Oh my god...
 Ross:What you you really quit your job?
 Ross:Oh hey...
 Ross:(reading off his card) A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet. -- How did you know?
 Ross:Hi guys.
 Ross:Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesnt she look cute?
 Ross:I think shes gonna be the hit of the office huh? Shes gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
 Ross:Yeah after you punched that one guy who got it wrong word spread. 
 Ross:Good one Rach.
 Ross:Rach we have a code brown situation.
 Ross:Alright but you have to do one sometime.
 Ross:What? No thats illegal. Im gonna have the labor department down her so fast they wont even...
 Ross:What about Emma? We dont have a nanny.
 Ross:Absolutely. Just give me your breast and well be on our way.
 Ross:Fine fine. (To Emma) Well have fun wont we? Yes we will yes we will. (Gives her a kiss and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)
 Ross:Huh?
 Ross:So you have to tell Monica you dont want to have a baby right now?
 Ross:(Hugs Chandler) Good-bye.
 Ross:Yeah and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
 Ross:I dont feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
 Ross:Pants off Bing!
 Ross:Hey.
 Ross:You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
 Ross:Heres an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
 Ross:You know what? I dont need a tie. I mean its better open collar. You know its more casual (He leaves.)
 Ross:Hey you guys!
 Ross:Uh good news everyone we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points to Molly). Molly Chandler Joey.
 Ross:Ooh somebodys getting a little fussy.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:Eh I mean I mena shes not unattractive but hot? I ....

 Ross:Come on there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her ok? Just shes off limits.
 Ross:What are you a child?
 Ross:Joey come on now for me! Please just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
 Ross:Whazzup??
 Ross:Listen can you do me a favor? Im gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
 Ross:Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter the hot nanny.
 Ross:You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man Im sure hell lose interest in a week or two but for now can you please just do this for me?
 Ross:Well we gotta do something ok? Nannies like her dont grow on trees. (pause)
 Ross:I am yes.

 Ross:Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
 Ross:OK you...you really dont know what I am talking about?
 Ross:OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
 Ross:Right thats why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony
 Ross:Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on thats fine!
 Ross:No Im serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I dont care but...at least she could have told me. You know
 Ross:I dont know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
 Ross:Well and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
 Ross:Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
 Ross:Thats funny...Do you think youll ever work again?
 Ross:I cant believe Rachel just moved on and didnt say anything to me
 Ross:No no about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
 Ross:No. When he called I...I threw the message away.
 Ross:You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
 Ross:You dont have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us like college remember? You...you break the
 Ross:Dont you have to be at work?
 Ross:Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question Would you...
 Ross:Hi! I could help not notice but thats an unusual necklace
 Ross:Right so thats a firm no. I cannot believe this I just keep striking out.
 Ross:This is great. Rachels gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and Im gonna die alone.
 Ross:I know! (he stands)
 Ross:But what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
 Ross:Uh-ah!
 Ross:(pfew). Good choice Ross.
 Ross:Oh yeah hello well now here I am.
 Ross:Oh yeah yeah that�s Michelle.
 Ross:Oh just this woman I�ve been seeing.
 Ross:Yeah didn�t I mention that? Yeah I mean we haven�t being going out for too long but rather there is this
 Ross:How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh I am sorry Michelle that�s
 Ross:I told you about my daughter.
 Ross:I told you it wasn�t long but there is an amazing connection between us.
 Ross:Are you kidding?
 Ross:We�ll see.
 Ross:I don�t know are we just kissing guys on balconies?
 Ross:Through the magic of sight! I was here putting our child to sleep...
 Ross:When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know for what? A week?
 Ross:Ok Michelle it�s time to go.
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:You know if it�s meant to be I�ll guess it. Bye bye.
 Ross:Oh I am sorry did you not like her because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
 Ross:Oh really!
 Ross:Oh really!
 Ross:What about the guy from the bar?
 Ross:The guy you gave your number to.
 Ross:Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
 Ross:I never gave it to you.
 Ross:I don�t know.
 Ross:Who am I?
 Ross:I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!
 Ross:None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
 Ross:Uh clearly.
 Ross:Yeah maybe not. So what you wanna do?
 Ross:Hey youre not naked! So hey Rach when will we expect to see you tonight?
 Ross:Bye! Hey I hope Emma isnt making it too hard on you.
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Yeah thatll do it.
 Ross:Im Im okay.
 Ross:Sure I mean do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know Im disappointed but its not like its a divorce.
 Ross:No its not a divorce it is not a divorce! Anyway I think Rachel and I need to you know get on with our lives maybe maybe start seeing other people.
 Ross:Yeah sure why not? In fact if you know anyone that would be good for me...
 Ross:Yeah? Any names come to mind?
 Ross:Excuse me is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height dark hair perhaps doing a puzzle?
 Ross:Well if Im still here in an hour buy him a drink on me.
 Ross:Nah I dont know if I should. I dont wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
 Ross:Yeah its no big deal. Its just a blind date.
 Ross:No!
 Ross:Eh if it was meant to be its meant to be.
 Ross:Wow free crab cakes. Well thats nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
 Ross:Just the crab cakes.
 Ross:Whats - whats going on?
 Ross:What? You - youre making money off my misery?
 Ross:This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now if youll wrap up my free crab cakes Ill be on my way.
 Ross:Hey whats wrong?
 Ross:Oh. Crab cake?
 Ross:Well what happened?
 Ross:Monica told me you had a blind date.
 Ross:I did too.
 Ross:But is it technically a date if the other person doesnt show up?
 Ross:Why does everyone keep saying that?
 Ross:That bad?
 Ross:Female body inspector? What size is that?
 Ross:The first date weve had in months and they were both such disasters.
 Ross:Wait a minute; you dont think it was intentional? I mean thats just stupid.
 Ross:I know. A double blind date and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
 Ross:So uh what kinda stuff do you think theyll have you do there?
 Ross:You know if I didnt already have a job I think I would have been really good in advertising.
 Ross:Yes I did I did! (He turns to Joey disappointed) I should have written it down!
 Ross:Oh I cant. Ive got a date with that waitress Katy yeah I know weve been only going out like twice but I have a really good feeling about her. 
 Ross:(taken aback) What?
 Ross:O-ok. Just relax Phoene just stay calm. (He searches his coat and freaks out). Oh my god I cant find my wallet. 
 Ross:(still in a high-pitched voice) What do you mean no? I knew youd be my death Phoebe Buffay. 
 Ross:Yeah a real pleasure.
 Ross:(shocked) Oh my god. Phoebe you used to mug people? 
 Ross:Hey youll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!
 Ross:(sitting down) Yah because Phoebe knew the mugger! 
 Ross:You wanna know how she knew him? (He points at Phoebe) Because Phoebe used to mug people. 
 Ross:Well anyway it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him because (menacingly) I was about to do some serious damage! 
 Ross:Yeah it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marcs Comics… you know I-I-I was just there minding my own business you know seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week- 
 Ross:Anyway I was heading towards this bakery you know to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone… (He looks at Monica) … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says Gimme your money punk!
 Ross:I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book Science Boy
 Ross:A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
 Ross:Well I-I better get to class (He stands up) Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way Phoebe?
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:No one ever asked me that whats wrong? 
 Ross:Oh… (He looks positively surprised) Well uhm there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…
 Ross:(disbelieving) Wh-What are you talking about? It wasnt a girl. It was this huge dude.
 Ross:No it wasnt.
 Ross:No it wasnt. You dont think I wouldve defended myself against a fourteen year-old…
 Ross:(shocked) Oh my god it was you! I cant believe it you… you mugged me? 
 Ross:Its not the best!
 Ross:(indignant) Theres nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. 
 Ross:(interrupting) Hey lets not do this! 
 Ross:Sure go ahead. Whoops sorry sure go ahead. (He raises his hands as if being mugged)
 Ross:(faking enthusiasm) Oh my god crap from the street? (She smiles excitedly but Ross just turns back to his newspaper) 
 Ross:Oh my god. (He sighs) I never thought Id see this again. (He browses trough the pages) Its all here. What made you save it all these years? 
 Ross:You really thought Science Boy was worth saving! 
 Ross:Still… this is amazing… Oh my god thank you Phoebe. 
 Ross:Youre welcome. 
 Ross:(entering) Hey uhm Phoebe didnt by any chance mention that…
 Ross:I see. You didnt happen to tell…
 Ross:Great. Thanks! (He leaves)
 Ross:I cant believe you guys are moving in together. Thats thats great! I mean...Im happy for you guys..
 Ross:Phoebe I had no idea you were so conventional.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Oh great now youre seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
 Ross:Why?
 Ross:Never?
 Ross:wow are you still going to move in with him?
 Ross:Yeah marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
 Ross:No Im sorry. Look I dont think thats what you wanna hear right now but I cant help it. I love marriage.
 Ross:If you have to call me name I prefer Ross the Divorcer. Its just cooler. Look I know my marriage isnt exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. Im sorry.
 Ross:But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
 Ross:Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before and you know what? You should be. Its a big deal!
 Ross:The Divorcer to the rescue!
 Ross:Yeah I just hurt it.
 Ross:Hey! What do you guys think about this. Ross The Divorce-Force.
 Ross:Hey Pheebs you know Im im really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
 Ross:Good good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it the more I realised I dont think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
 Ross:Well I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
 Ross:I dont know youd be so bored with marriage. I mean its so... normal.
 Ross:Hey hey can I help?
 Ross:You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
 Ross:Oh yeah let me just finish this.
 Ross:Have you seen this? Its a new alumni website for college! Its cool! You can post messages for people let everyone know what youre up to.
 Ross:Its actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
 Ross:Uh uh... well her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
 Ross:No... I already e-mailed her.
 Ross:You know what? Im gonna finish this later ok? Let me just grab my coat.
 Ross:(he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
 Ross:(he comes back) Alright lets go!
 Ross:I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
 Ross:(yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
 Ross:That only is not funny its physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species Id have to have a six foot long... (pause) Its not funny!!
 Ross:I cant believe you put that on my alumni page!
 Ross:Youd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
 Ross:Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
 Ross:(visibly upset) Im dead?
 Ross:Posting that I died? That really isnt funny.
 Ross:Oh please hit by a blimp?
 Ross:Unbelievable my classmates are gonna think Im dead my professors my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. Youre messing with peoples feelings here.
 Ross:Youve really crossed the line here but thats okay its ok cause Im on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. Thats right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
 Ross:uhu uhu check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
 Ross:Eh..actually no I dont need to because your little Ross is dead joke didnt work ok there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website nobody called my parents so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called nobody wrote anything nobody cares that Im dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that Im dead!?
 Ross:What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didnt get one response! And Im dead!
 Ross:I cant believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
 Ross:Youre right. There isnt a decent outlet.
 Ross:Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
 Ross:No! That would be stupid! Youre having it for me!
 Ross:oh too late too late! Its sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
 Ross:Its been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
 Ross:Ok ok! Im gonna go hide! Oh this is so exciting my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
 Ross:Who is he?
 Ross:I dont remember him but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
 Ross:(coming in) Im dead and no one cares?
 Ross:It isnt ridiculous look around! No ones here!
 Ross:Yes youre right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean I went to that school for 4 years I didnt have an impact on anyone?
 Ross:(sceptical) Yeah...
 Ross:(he bounds into the lounge room) But you didnt! Im still alive!! Kori I know this is a big surprise for you. Its a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
 Ross:Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
 Ross:(on the phone) No Mum Im not dead. I know its not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me but its over ok? (pause) Actually no even if I had died you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?
 Ross:No thanks!
 Ross:(in a mocking voice)Uh...sure I do and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
 Ross:The woman just vanished!
 Ross:No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
 Ross:Seriously you guys I cant believe youre going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery I mean thats such a bunch of boohaki.
 Ross:Oh oh we think Emma is about to start talking so were trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
 Ross:(yelling to Monica)Theyre towing your car theyre towing your car!!
 Ross:(panting)Theyre towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
 Ross:Yeah uh... and then I figured after you win we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
 Ross:(to Monica)Think he washed his hands?
 Ross:(mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
 Ross:(mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
 Ross:You know what Im sure your wish is gonna come true but you guys - just in case maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp stops because its very hot) Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
 Ross:Uh youre not gonna win.
 Ross:Ok Ive heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
 Ross:Why would I eat my own arm?
 Ross:Why?
 Ross:You dont have to do that Ill pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - thats so sweet! Come here (they kiss and hug)
 Ross:I dont know probably just invest it.
 Ross:Oh Im sorry did I say invest it? I meant be cool and piss it all away (Joey and Chandler pleased)
 Ross:(to Rachel) Uh how long until they announce the numbers Mommy?
 Ross:Oh Ive gotten into the habit of calling Rachel Mommy when were around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
 Ross:Although if were gonna do that we should probably call me Daddy too.
 Ross:I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
 Ross:(tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I cant.
 Ross:I cant believe this I thought we were all in this together!
 Ross:3 minutes ago!!! I dont know why thats important ...
 Ross:Than I want mine too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win Im gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
 Ross:(trying to stop her) Hey hey!!
 Ross:Monica!
 Ross:Go go go!!
 Ross:Weird.. your psychic didnt mention anything about the scary pigeon...
 Ross:Oh yeah its a good idea!
 Ross:(on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember youre daddys little girl... (covering the phone to Rachel) Phoebes totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to Rachel)
 Ross:Oh we have one too!!
 Ross:(calling Rachel) Come on!!
 Ross:Oh yeah no no no...thats great!
 Ross:Oh Rach...oh...gleba is not a word.
 Ross:Okay what does it mean?
 Ross:Im just Im just glad I didnt miss my daughters first words (goes back to checking the tickets).
 Ross:Yes you did gleba is a word!
 Ross:Ok use it in a sentence.
 Ross:Its not a word!
 Ross:Oh oh ok great. You know what while youre at it she said another word the other day why dont you why dont you look up pbbqqt....
 Ross:Shes gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head very moved)
 Ross:Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
 Ross:Phoebe you dont have any of the first five numbers.
 Ross:I guess if everybody else is...
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:Id love to!
 Ross:Phoebe what happened?
 Ross:Oh dont worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
 Ross:Well this is what happens when people live on the edge!
 Ross:Uh dont you think that would be a little weird? I mean two guys in a romantic inn...
 Ross:(browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
 Ross:(in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
 Ross:Yeah I ate all my gifts for everybody.
 Ross:(high pitched voice) Check again please!
 Ross:Not there.
 Ross:(mumbling) She doesnt know what to say!
 Ross:Totally insane. Dude lets drive home well hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if theyre closed maybe well tap a tree and make some ourselves.
 Ross:Dude dont worry bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel you know plenty of amenities we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one Im... I take six!
 Ross:Cmon you get the idea ow-ow-ow well make our money back in no time!
 Ross:I think its the sugar could you hold the apple?
 Ross:(on the phone) Hi this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush toothpaste razor mouthwash deodorant dental floss band aids shaving cream after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I havent asked for already? (pause) Yeah go ahead send up some tampons.
 Ross:What did you get?
 Ross:Nice put it with the others.
 Ross:We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive I love being in the country!
 Ross:Oh thats not cool.
 Ross:No Chandler you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example hair drier no no no but shampoo and conditioners yes yes yes. (pause) Now the salt shaker is off-limits but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish Id thought this through.
 Ross:Not my first time in a hotel my friend.
 Ross:No no no you cant take the remote control!
 Ross:Lets celebrate with some maple candy!
 Ross:At least tell me where you hid it.
 Ross:Oh dude dont worry about it I found an unattended maids car. Were way ahead of the game.
 Ross:Oh my god.
 Ross:Theres something new in the bowl.
 Ross:No but I want...I want the pinecones!
 Ross:Its not the same.
 Ross:(to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
 Ross:Oh my maple candy!
 Ross:(sounds excited) Hi you guys! whats going on you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
 Ross:Yeah it does sound interesting I mean to listen to a woman complain for two hours I dont think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring faking to fall asleep)
 Ross:What? How come that you dont have to go!
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Hey you guys wont believe what I have to do for work today.
 Ross:(covering with his hand Chandlers face like pretending hes not there) (to Monica) Therere these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
 Ross:Its I just know theyre gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
 Ross:(looking his elbow where theres a patch) These arent suede.
 Ross:Hi hi Im Ross Geller.
 Ross:Oh oh thats thats thats nice.
 Ross:Oh no its no big deal I mean if I werent doing this Id just you know be at the gym working out.
 Ross:Oh ha I wrote that in one minute.
 Ross:(hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going you know we got a lot of ground to cover.
 Ross:I dont think so.
 Ross:Oh well hes obviously late and the rule in my class is if you cant come on time then dont come at all. (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?
 Ross:You know what hes a big boy Im sure hell find us ok?
 Ross:Oh damn it!
 Ross:(very bored he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So where did you get your undergraduate degree?
 Ross:(to Charlie) Oh its not over!
 Ross:So basically all nuts?
 Ross:Ive lost the will to live.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:Oh... ok fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk or run or prance or stroll...
 Ross:(entering with Charlie) Oh hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie this is Phoebe and my sister Monica.
 Ross:Yeah Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
 Ross:(to Phoebe) Ranions theory of species variegation?
 Ross:Oh my God shes great! I mean we-we have so much in common and shes just cool and funny...
 Ross:Really? Wh-whats wrong?
 Ross:Im sorry Rachel this is Charlie Wealer shes a collegue.
 Ross:(looking at them) Wh-whats going on?
 Ross:No I arranged that...
 Ross:(to Charlie) So eh... its probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston huh?
 Ross:Ooh... so sad... Still it cant be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
 Ross:You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
 Ross:... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean thats like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
 Ross:Eh you think? I mean you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
 Ross:(very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused but smiling) Oh Im sorry I dont mean to pry... its just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch Access Hollywood.
 Ross:Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
 Ross:(a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Dont tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
 Ross:Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasnt won the Nobel Prize?
 Ross:Oh yeah? no no Nobel Prizes for him?
 Ross:Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
 Ross:(sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine Im going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
 Ross:She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God at the chinese restaurant earlier today I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
 Ross:Of course you would your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man I cant compete with the guys she goes out with they are so out of my league! oh my God!
 Ross:Oh much much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) Can we walk? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh you... you like that?
 Ross:What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
 Ross:Nice to meet you.
 Ross:Oh Im no actor Im a professor of palaeontology.
 Ross:Oh well no but I mean she only goes out with really really smart guys.
 Ross:Id lead with that.
 Ross:Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
 Ross:Its actually a 1000000$ prize.
 Ross:Yeah maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers Ive written were widely discredited.
 Ross:And sexy.
 Ross:Yeah youre right thanks Pheebs Im gonna go find her.
 Ross:Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
 Ross:(to Rachel) Hey Rach have you seen Charlie anywhere?
 Ross:Im smarter than him!
 Ross:Hey I thought Id end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
 Ross:Yes she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
 Ross:Why do you care so much?
 Ross:Oh I dont know they seem to have a shared interest in each others tonsils...
 Ross:Yeah its no big deal. I mean I just met her and Im fine with it...
 Ross:Oh God. I forgot how hot she was!
 Ross:Im gonna get some more coffee.
 Ross:Ok. (they both go)
 Ross:Uhm no! Think less of you! No I dont think less of you. I mean you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean those people who like someone and dont kiss them... those-those people are stupid I hate those people.
 Ross:Yeah I know the type.
 Ross:Hi!
 Ross:(annoyed) Oh do you do you really?
 Ross:Look if you dont know what the word acrimonious means just dont use it!
 Ross:Get to the problem!
 Ross:(looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
 Ross:You were saying you didnt want to seem stupid.
 Ross:You know I really dont want to get involved in you guys relationship.
 Ross:(after a short hesitation) Fine.
 Ross:Ok. Lets see. Oh you should take her to the MET!
 Ross:Oh no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Ross:Yeah most of it its a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
 Ross:Yeah uh uh ok theres this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patricks Cathedral and there theres this great little pastry shop that shed love.
 Ross:But Im not! (pause). You know what if youre in the mood for Thai food...
 Ross:Ok.
 Ross:Ok when you walk in the museum take the right thats the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt Mesopotamia up to the Byzantine Empire.
 Ross:Now do you have any idea what you just said?
 Ross:Ok now remember when you get to the museum Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
 Ross:Yeah yeah that means... you know? We just... we dont have time for this.
 Ross:Ok but you know what? I gotta say Im really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
 Ross:Wow. What does that mean?
 Ross:Ok! So lets move on to the Renaissance?
 Ross:Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing and dude you cant touch the paintings.
 Ross:No! (Slaps his hand)
 Ross:Haha! Got ya! Die die die!
 Ross:(recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully professor R. Geller. (hits <return> closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!
 Ross:Hey how was the Met?
 Ross:Yeah? Joey really knows his art huh?
 Ross:What do you mean?
 Ross:(perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met did you go to the right?
 Ross:(shaking head) Oh Joey Joey! But still I mean it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
 Ross:What?
 Ross:What I mean a little but no what go on.
 Ross:(slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean hes a great guy and sure he doesnt know that much about art but you know you can always talk about that with someone else.
 Ross:And if you think about it I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know thats the kind of guy Joey is.
 Ross:That was going to be my next argument.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:Glad I could help man.
 Ross:(entering) Hey you guys!
 Ross:Guess whos up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
 Ross:Yeah right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well why are you laughing?
 Ross:Professor Sherman yeah. Ive a meeting with him today.
 Ross:Yeah well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
 Ross:Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
 Ross:Wait a minute you guys. Oh I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do Id love for you guys to come and hear me.
 Ross:Its in Barbados.
 Ross:So-so what did the doctor say?
 Ross:How do you feel about all this?
 Ross:(puzzled) What?
 Ross:(looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
 Ross:The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
 Ross:(reading from a notepad) I mean weve been accepting Leakeys dates as a given but if theyre off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean not just in palaeontology but if-if you think about it in evolutionary biology uh genetics geology uh I mean truly the mind boggles!
 Ross:Oh thats not what you want...
 Ross:Joey! Hey I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
 Ross:Im meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
 Ross:It could be better! He uhm... he fell asleep!
 Ross:Barbados.
 Ross:What am I supposed to do? Hes out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
 Ross:I cant! If he realizes that Im the one that put him to sleep I wont get the job!
 Ross:(To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
 Ross:Oh thats right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. Were going to a conference in Barbados right?
 Ross:(to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
 Ross:Ok I gotta say. I mean it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And Ive a surprise uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! Thats right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
 Ross:Oh right because hes a scientist!
 Ross:Ok we gotta go yeah? So well see you guys tomorrow.
 Ross:Its a blanket Joe not a cloak of invisibility!
 Ross:(very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
 Ross:Wow! This is very flattering uh...
 Ross:Uh uh... Sure! Uhm... Dear... (he takes the notepad)
 Ross:... Sarah. I dig you Uh? Doctor Ross Geller.
 Ross:Yeah oh and Sarah... Id like to introduce you to my colleague uh Professor Wheeler a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
 Ross:Dude its just Days of Our Lives... theres no the.
 Ross:Hey!
 Ross:(Excited) Youre never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
 Ross:Yeah she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
 Ross:Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
 Ross:(to Charlie) Ready to go?
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:(a little embarassed by their conversation) Im good I have dinner plans (moves away from them).
 Ross:Uh Joe have you looked outside?
 Ross:By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
 Ross:Oh and you know what it will be even better tomorrow because I wont be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door Ross goes to open and its Joey Rachel and Chandler).
 Ross:The chocolates arent here yet.
 Ross:If you want to check your email just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)
 Ross:Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
 Ross:What oh my God. What did you do?
 Ross:Why why would you open it?
 Ross:What did it say?
 Ross:What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone Chandler!
 Ross:NO! I dont!!
 Ross:Yep! Id like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
 Ross:Yeah well you should! I mean nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean shes never even won a major tournament!
 Ross:Get out! (Chandler runs out)
 Ross:Well what do you do?
 Ross:I cant believe this. I cant believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
 Ross:I dont think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now Joe!
 Ross:Wha... what you really think we can do that?
 Ross:Alright ok lets do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm and then then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era the breakup of Pangea hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then theres the... eh... theres the overview of the Triassic.
 Ross:Yeah thats it?
 Ross:Oh my God we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
 Ross:Yes but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing thank you thank you so much. (he leans in and they look at each other for a moment) Thats a pretty necklace.
 Ross:Hey what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
 Ross:Oh my God I love you.
 Ross:Thats Ben my son from my first marriage.
 Ross:Yeah.
 Ross:No. (they clink glasses and drink)
 Ross:(embarassed) Oh it was... its complicated you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
 Ross:Ok odd thing to get excited about!
 Ross:Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
 Ross:My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didnt get any fitter.
 Ross:I know! Its like if you knew why didnt you tell me you know? I mean call or leave a note Hi I just dropped by to say your wifes gay
 Ross:And then you try to make the best of a bad situation so you float the idea of a threesome?
 Ross:(embarassed) Me neither.
 Ross:Yep we got it we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.
 Ross:Good night.
 Ross:(from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin guys!
 Ross:Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
 Ross:Finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered Gigantosaurus Argentinasaurus...
 Ross:And thats just the herbivores. Im not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
 Ross:But all kidding aside in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
 Ross:... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
 Ross:(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
 Ross:Oh thanks guys!
 Ross:Oh!
 Ross:(with a frozen smile on his face realizing somethings wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now were just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
 Ross:Oh thank you so much!
 Ross:(puzzled) Ok!... All right thanks! Thank you so much you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh I cant tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
 Ross:(skating over embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
 Ross:Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
 Ross:Yeah?
 Ross:Oh I cant tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
 Ross:No its ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
 Ross:(joking) Id better not found you naked in my hotel room!
 Ross:(realizing his joke wasnt so good but still giggling) Look I took it too far!
 Ross:Ooh well. Ah I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now not that I wouldnt love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)
 Ross:Get Out!
 Ross:Yes please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So whats going on?
 Ross:Oh my God wh-what happened?
 Ross:I knew that was him!
 Ross:(holding her hand) Hey you ok?
 Ross:Oh professor Clerk were kind of in the middle of a conversation here.
 Ross:(standing) Ok gentlemen! Please! Arent we a little old for this? I mean were scientists right? Were academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO GO GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)
 Ross:Hi.
 Ross:Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know we as a group are not the coolest.
 Ross:I dont think they saw us.
 Ross:(apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
 Ross:I think I know too but Ive been really wrong about this stuff in the past so...
 Ross:Im sorry... we... we cant.
 Ross:I mean you just went out with my best friend and I just think itd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)
