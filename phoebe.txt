 Phoebe:Thats the door. Hes gone...
 Phoebe:Oh were just... were sad to go so were just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)
 Phoebe:Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.

 Phoebe:For how long?
 Phoebe:Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business but uhm how long do you think youre gonna keep seeing her?
 Phoebe:Oh okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home maybe therell be a special delivery package waiting for you.
 Phoebe:You know what were gonna have sex. Lets just leave it there.
 Phoebe:Hi Mikes place.
 Phoebe:Ooh that was fast.
 Phoebe:Yeah you cant do that! Oh come on Mike strap on a pair.Why dont you just tell her that we got back together. You know women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
 Phoebe:Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
 Phoebe:Okay oh and you know if she gets upset just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)
 Phoebe:(stunned) I... Im Phoebe.
 Phoebe:Enchanté (she holds out her hand and they shake hands)
 Phoebe:Okay bye. Alright so Mikes on his way over. See you thought you guys were meeting here and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant so you know... Doesnt really matter whos right or wrong. Point is... Im gonna take off.
 Phoebe:Alright... Susie can I call you Susie?
 Phoebe:Yeah I cant say that. uhm... Susie Im gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And hes very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
 Phoebe:Well I dont...
 Phoebe:Nothing theres nothing wrong with you.
 Phoebe:Damn it woman pull yourself together! Have some pride for the love of God.
 Phoebe:Okay not a fan of the tough love.
 Phoebe:But he didnt really know you know. He wasnt planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
 Phoebe:Look Precious... Mikes not worth this. Youre an attractive intelligent woman and lets face it Mikes kind of a wang. I mean he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And I dont like to kiss-and-tell but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
 Phoebe:Youre welcome!
 Phoebe:Hey guys!
 Phoebe:Hey have you seen Frank Jr. cause hes meeting me here with the triplets.
 Phoebe:Hey whats all this stuff?
 Phoebe:Ooh babies! Oh this one is so cute get this one!
 Phoebe:Oh how does it work?
 Phoebe:Well if youre having a hard time you should talk to my friends Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. Im sure theyd help you.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Good to see you.
 Phoebe:Oh god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
 Phoebe:Well they may be a handful but theyre so cute.
 Phoebe:Oh god the last time I babysat them they did the funniest thing..
 Phoebe:Thats a thats a long time.
 Phoebe:Yeah I know Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh my god Frank are you thinking of leaving? Because I didnt have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
 Phoebe:What?! You cant separate them! Thats terrible. Which one?
 Phoebe:Okay well this is crazy. Cant seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids can we?
 Phoebe:Insane.
 Phoebe:Alice would never go for it right?
 Phoebe:Well just you know for arguments sake you know hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
 Phoebe:Frank Jr.Jr.?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Well alright thats fine. What about Leslie?
 Phoebe:Alright so that leaves Chandler.
 Phoebe:Wow Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
 Phoebe:Im sorry Frank. I didnt realise things were so bad. You know Ill help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day and Ill be there.
 Phoebe:Well thats not good. But you know I can move some stuff around and Ill be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
 Phoebe:Are you kidding? Thats what sisters are for.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Still he had to find out sometime.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh you wont believe who moved back to town.
 Phoebe:You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) Oh so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile! If-if you dont wanna get me on my mo-Bile dont call me on my mo-Bile!
 Phoebe:Oh I know! Oh...I slept with Billy Joel. All right who hasnt?
 Phoebe:Ugh Lets just cut her out!
 Phoebe:Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her till she gets the point!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
 Phoebe:Oh you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
 Phoebe:Ok don’t hold thy breath!
 Phoebe:Why why why didn’t you just say no!
 Phoebe:(leaving) Fine fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
 Phoebe:I did!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Oh! Well what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
 Phoebe:(makes a face) Are you kidding I love it!
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Musty!
 Phoebe:Well...kinda.
 Phoebe:Yeah well in America youre just an ass.
 Phoebe:(Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
 Phoebe:Oh Chandler! Thank God youre alive. Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
 Phoebe:Please Monica? In the hall?
 Phoebe:It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
 Phoebe:Youre also so generous and kind and scrappy!
 Phoebe:Exactly! Look no matter what I tried to do I couldnt keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
 Phoebe:Yeah you are. And Im so glad that you fought your way back in because I dont know what I would do without you.
 Phoebe:Yeah I guess youre right.
 Phoebe:Oooh I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids on our birthday our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
 Phoebe:Oh COOL!! Wow its like a time capsule!
 Phoebe:Oh just think... shes gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasnt even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And theyll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
 Phoebe:Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
 Phoebe:Joey its a birthday party.
 Phoebe:So you’re gonna... hit on her?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
 Phoebe:Separate performances.
 Phoebe:Sure yeah!
 Phoebe:(to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
 Phoebe:That’s right Ive prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
 Phoebe:No of course not! I also you know prepared a reading (she picks up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.
 Phoebe:And you know I have a massage client soon.
 Phoebe:Well if youre leaving Im definitely gonna go.
 Phoebe:Oh no! Hes not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)
 Phoebe:No it did not.
 Phoebe:Joey? How could you just let them leave?
 Phoebe:Wh.. what? No wait you dont get to leave! Ive got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
 Phoebe:Well oh ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok and as the person who realized that I get to go!
 Phoebe:No lets just draw straws.
 Phoebe:(Visibly excited) Yeah!! Lets do that!
 Phoebe:Ok! I want the dolphin!
 Phoebe:Im too excited!
 Phoebe:Go! Go!
 Phoebe:Good job Alan!
 Phoebe:Yeah see you later!
 Phoebe:Hey are Ross and Rachel back?
 Phoebe:Oh good I didnt miss the party.
 Phoebe:I just felt so bad missing this. So I just slipped him a little something you know. As long as Im back in five or six hours it will be alright.
 Phoebe:(pointing at cake) Hey you made it into a bunny.
 Phoebe:(yelling at the top of her voice) Go go go Alan! Run you hairy bastard!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yes I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
 Phoebe:YEAH!
 Phoebe:Uh-uh. Ehm a Knicks game.
 Phoebe:Hey you know what Ive never had a one-year anniversary before so no matter where we go Im wearing something fancy pants and... Im gonna put on my finest jewelry and were gonna have sex in a public rest room.
 Phoebe:Excuse me anniversary. Excuse me anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm sir could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. Its my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe its been a whole year!
 Phoebe:ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
 Phoebe:YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOURE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
 Phoebe:Oh how lame... oh it’s so tacky and impersonal.
 Phoebe:Oh it’s the worst way to propose!
 Phoebe:Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
 Phoebe:Well mine was worse than that.
 Phoebe:We were at the game and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
 Phoebe:Well that’s what I said but it turns out Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
 Phoebe:Yeah I really do! Yes but after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean I said no in Barbados and now this!
 Phoebe:Oh I dont know I dont know isnt that a little desperate?
 Phoebe:(To Rachel and Ross) Well do you think I should propose?
 Phoebe:Ok ok so how should I do it?
 Phoebe:Yeah that does make sense. Ok now would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?
 Phoebe:No Ive got work and then Im proposing..
 Phoebe:Uhuh uhuh... (seems distracted)
 Phoebe:Im not. Im praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?
 Phoebe:Well I think you should wait.
 Phoebe:Well if you dont... if you dont hold it in you dont get all the nutrients.
 Phoebe:Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
 Phoebe:Thats not very enlightened!
 Phoebe:Hey hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!
 Phoebe:That woman at the game didnt know what she was talking about. Mike obviously you have balls.
 Phoebe:(the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose I promise Ill say yes. Whether... whether you know it is in a basketball game or in sky writing or you know like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
 Phoebe:Its in the cake isnt it?
 Phoebe:Whats the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? Im sorry Im sorry!
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb and takes all of these off.)
 Phoebe:Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)
 Phoebe:Yes!
 Phoebe:I love you more!
 Phoebe:(she enters) Hey...
 Phoebe:Oh Im just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!
 Phoebe:Well it was really sweet and like the most romantic thing ever.
 Phoebe:Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh and I have something for you!
 Phoebe:Its yes my little black book. Its got the numbers of all the guys Ive dated.
 Phoebe:I would but youre the last one.
 Phoebe:Oh my first love!
 Phoebe:Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh its OK no he was old yeah! And he lived a full life he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
 Phoebe:(proud of herself) Oh yes they are.
 Phoebe:(looking at Monica entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Well I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh its so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
 Phoebe:A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
 Phoebe:Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh I know!! Oh you should take her!
 Phoebe:Why you dont like her?
 Phoebe:Really? You think?
 Phoebe:Ok Ill fight for her. Ok! Oh wait oh I just realized... if I do that that means you dont get her.
 Phoebe:Hi! Sorry Im late.
 Phoebe:No he really hates it. But hes gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is Gladys is yours!
 Phoebe:Oh shes that work of art I made you know with the woman coming out of the frame.
 Phoebe:Oh I didnt know you wanted her too!
 Phoebe:Girls girls stop ok? Well flip a coin. Heads shes Rachels tails shes Monicas. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica shes yours!
 Phoebe:(smiling from ear to ear) Well Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the painting)
 Phoebe:(genuinely excited about it) Yeah yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
 Phoebe:Really? It doesnt have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
 Phoebe:Hey! (theres a pause)
 Phoebe:You guys! You guys! You dont have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesnt get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
 Phoebe:I knew it!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Its really crazy! The hall the dress the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
 Phoebe:So what did you two do about it?
 Phoebe:But really it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
 Phoebe:Yeah! Now how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
 Phoebe:Yes. Were here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
 Phoebe:Well I think youre gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)
 Phoebe:And we dont want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
 Phoebe:Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
 Phoebe:Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
 Phoebe:Sure I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
 Phoebe:Oh look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)
 Phoebe:Mhm... its moist.
 Phoebe:Hello is this the creepy residence?
 Phoebe:Awe this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
 Phoebe:No no no we’re not having a big reception we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
 Phoebe:We you know we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you but oh please I put this on? (she puts it on) And ow I look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster) why well radiant. (pause) All right well who cares I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
 Phoebe:City Hall.
 Phoebe:It’s ok it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
 Phoebe:Well I’ll just ask for it back!
 Phoebe:It’s for our wedding day! Right now is this guy gay or straight because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
 Phoebe:The donation we made earlier we k… we w… we want it back.
 Phoebe:Yeah. See that money was for a big wedding that we thought we didn’t want but it turns out we do.
 Phoebe:I am sorry. I am but this wedding is just really important to me.
 Phoebe:Hey that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)
 Phoebe:(Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
 Phoebe:Yeah I really do. You know I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few 
 Phoebe:Look I cant have a wedding with this money now. Its tainted.
 Phoebe:And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time my friend hasnt shot 
 Phoebe:(to the Charity guy) Were back!
 Phoebe:Yeah because you know what its... its all about the children.
 Phoebe:Although... its also about the wedding... Ugh alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
 Phoebe:But... but... but were giving you this!
 Phoebe:(looks at the amount on the check and gasps) Well this is very generous!
 Phoebe:Oh is that you?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well personally I think its great youre giving yourself a break.
 Phoebe:Sure. Its just as well... I mean last year wasnt very good. I think shes losing her touch.
 Phoebe:Am I? Really? Am I? Well why dont you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well think about it think about it youll be trying to top than you did last year. Youd be in competition... with yourself.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah happy needless-turkey-murder day.
 Phoebe:Youre not making the pies yourself?
 Phoebe:Hey Rach.
 Phoebe:Whats Emma doing today?
 Phoebe:Well I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
 Phoebe:Okay but well before you say no my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma shes a real dog!
 Phoebe:(sarcastic) Oh... okay.
 Phoebe:Okay oh and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
 Phoebe:Well I was thinking...
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:We cant leave now! There was this one baby Haley who was favourite to win and she got croup so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open folks!
 Phoebe:Oh I know we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) Its okay. Now the way I see it our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
 Phoebe:(panicking) But Emmas got what it takes she could go all the way!
 Phoebe:Okay. Rachel the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Good! Oh yay! Lets get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
 Phoebe:Well shes gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
 Phoebe:Why not!
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:No were late!
 Phoebe:Dont point that thing at me Tribbiani!
 Phoebe:Uh we were at the Spelling Bee!
 Phoebe:And it looks like she put makeup on her!
 Phoebe:You guys there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
 Phoebe:Alright what are we gonna say?
 Phoebe:Oh good thats good but you dont look like you were mugged!
 Phoebe:Were just... were trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this We can say that Monica told us 5 oclock not 4 oclock. That way were right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
 Phoebe:Well Im not going in first. I bet that vein on Monicas forehead is popping like crazy.
 Phoebe:Oh really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his fire and mimics a bursting water balloon thus putting the fire out).
 Phoebe:Its locked.
 Phoebe:What are we gonna do? Im starving.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah!
 Phoebe:Well I dont know if thats such a good idea. They clearly dont want to be with us.
 Phoebe:So bad.
 Phoebe:Pies oh we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emmas trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).
 Phoebe:Come on you guys lets just do our own Thanksgiving.
 Phoebe:Ill pull you through.
 Phoebe:Ive already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
 Phoebe:Just a sec. were kind in the middle of something here.
 Phoebe:I know. Have you considered pageanting?
 Phoebe:Oh right! Your adoption interview!
 Phoebe:What are you gonna name the baby?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh thats Sarah. No no. Dont you get any ideas ok? No Im not setting you up with any more of my friends!
 Phoebe:Because youll date her once sleep with her and then forget she exists!
 Phoebe:Mandy.
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Fine Ill give you her number.
 Phoebe:SARAH!
 Phoebe:Well you know if you want fashion help Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. Youre more than welcome to come with us right?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
 Phoebe:Yeah! So youre gonna call this one back?
 Phoebe:What are you talking about? Sarahs great!
 Phoebe:That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So she took some fries big deal!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
 Phoebe:(to Rachel) Oh
 Phoebe:Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
 Phoebe:Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
 Phoebe:What? You know about the plate thing?
 Phoebe:(to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
 Phoebe:Well I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
 Phoebe:(to Ross) This place is awesome!
 Phoebe:Wow!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:What? They will be!
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah but I am not sure about some of the bras I got.
 Phoebe:Oh! okay. Wait are we in Joeys imagination?
 Phoebe:oh well Ross probably has it you can get it from him later.
 Phoebe:Wait does he eat chalk?
 Phoebe:Just cause I dont want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
 Phoebe:Fine!  Be murky!
 Phoebe: If I let go of my hair my head will fall off.
 Phoebe:(sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...
 Phoebe:(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
 Phoebe:What does that mean?   Does he sell it drink it or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesnt know.)
 Phoebe:Ooh I just pulled out four eyelashes. That cant be good.
 Phoebe:Oh I wish I could but I dont want to.
 Phoebe:(singing) Love is sweet as summer showers love is a wondrous work of art but your love oh your love your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
 Phoebe:Oh no dont hate you dont want to put that out into the universe.
 Phoebe:All right cmere gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
 Phoebe:Give her a break its hard being on your own for the first time.
 Phoebe:Youre welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison and I got here and I didnt know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was like cleaning windshields outside port authority and then he killed himself and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me I know exactly how you feel.
 Phoebe:(sings) I cant believe what Im hearing here...
 Phoebe:(sings) What I said you had...
 Phoebe:Oh was I doing it again?
 Phoebe:If you had to what would you give up food or sex?
 Phoebe:Ross how about you. What would you give up sex or food?

 Phoebe:OH! Hes having an affair.
 Phoebe:You know Im always right about these things.
 Phoebe:Well Im sorry but its hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See theres something going on with them. Look hes getting into the car with her!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah? Well lets see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)
 Phoebe:Oh hi Chandler. Its Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
 Phoebe:(shocked) Oh well its a shame that you-that you miss the movie cause we were gonna see you know either Liar Liar or Betrayal or... An Affair To Remember.
 Phoebe:Ok then maybe itll be uhm...
 Phoebe:(glancing at her) What?
 Phoebe:(to Chandler at the phone) Okay we-well talk to you later. Okay bye.

 Phoebe:Well look whatever happens we’re here for you and we love you.
 Phoebe:They went in together. So sorry.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Why do you have a realtor?
 Phoebe:So youre gonna move?
 Phoebe:Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You cant move out of the city what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
 Phoebe:Wha..? Again with the nature what are you? Beavers?
 Phoebe:Yeah but so is this.
 Phoebe:You guys you know what I just realized? Joker is poker with a J. Coincidence?
 Phoebe:[looking outside the window] Eww look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.

 Phoebe:Oh my God! Monicas gonna totally freak out!
 Phoebe:Well of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkeys ass!
 Phoebe:Ok you guys I don’t mean to make things worse but umm I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.

 Phoebe:What else?
 Phoebe:That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
 Phoebe:Yeah you dont wanna live in Westchester. Thats like the worst of the Chesters.

 Phoebe:Oh yeah okay. Im uptight. Yeah thats why I dont want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
 Phoebe:Im sorry did you say all man or old man?

 Phoebe:Estelle? Why?
 Phoebe:I’m guessing she does.
 Phoebe:Well no no wait wait wait. All right I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.
 Phoebe:Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)
 Phoebe:Man tough week for Estelle!
 Phoebe:Hey Joey want come with me to… are you ok?
 Phoebe:No that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
 Phoebe:No no no! Dont call her! You wait for her to call you (Joey considers it)

 Phoebe:These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these theyll snap like a piece of licorice.
 Phoebe:Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles Chandler looks aghast)
 Phoebe:I dont know. But God Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
 Phoebe:You know maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
 Phoebe:Ross if youre this upset you should go and talk to her.
 Phoebe:Tell me about it.
 Phoebe:All right I think Im gonna head out.
 Phoebe:I thought I was going home to go to bed but Im sensing theres something less fun for me to do here.

 Phoebe:Dont make me do this again I dont like my voice like this.
 Phoebe:Ok who wants to hear something ironic?
 Phoebe:(singing) They found their bodies the very next day they found their bodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la.
 Phoebe:This is so great.
 Phoebe:I mean well cause when I was growing up you know my dad left and my mother died and my stepfather went to jail so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And heres this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that theyre fighting over who gets to love it the most. And its not even born yet. Its just its just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) Im sorry you were fighting.

 Phoebe:Here look alright does this help?
 Phoebe:Yeah but yknow its... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
 Phoebe:No I mean I mean when youre at the fifteenth date yknow youre already in a very relationshippy place. Yknow its... youre committed.
 Phoebe:Well I mean then what happens if it doesnt work out?
 Phoebe:Maybe theres someone else.
 Phoebe:Ok so this is pretty much whats happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since you know forever but every time he tried to tell her something kind of got in the way like cats and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like forget about her but when Ross was in China on his dig Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like Oh my god. So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back but what she didnt know was that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So thats pretty much everything you need to know. But enough about us. So howve you been?

 Phoebe:Ooh. Oh. It looks like like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (Ross gives her this look like Yeah doesnt it and gets up to dump it down the drain.)
 Phoebe:Maybe because you told him not to.

 Phoebe:Oh it’s the compulsively neat one by the window okay.
 Phoebe:I’m I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right I haven’t lived here in a while so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
 Phoebe:I am soo dead. (goes to Monica’s room)
 Phoebe:Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!

 Phoebe:It’s Monica’s bed. What?
 Phoebe:So. This has always been Monica’s bed what you’re just noticing now how self-involved are you?
 Phoebe:Well if you really really want it then it’s okay.
 Phoebe:No no it’s just my tooth.

 Phoebe:Because every time I go to the dentist somebody dies.
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah first there was my aunt Mary and then there was umm John my mailman and then my my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.
 Phoebe:Yes while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now yknow it’s not about oral hygiene I floss to save lives!
 Phoebe:Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t their dead.
 Phoebe:(trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
 Phoebe:All right fine fine but if you’re my next victim don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
 Phoebe:Although don’t feel like you can’t visit.
 Phoebe:Well you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist maybe I’ll kill him.
 Phoebe:Well I’m going to the dentist so listen okay just be on the look out for anything that that that you can fall into or or that can fall on you or... All right just look out! Okay And um I also just wanna I just wanna tell you all that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)
 Phoebe:(running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!
 Phoebe:Yeah well we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
 Phoebe:(on phone) ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay see ya!’

 Phoebe:Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know and everyone is alive.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too to bring down something that big.
 Phoebe:I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.

 Phoebe:You keep the old ones in the back that is so ageist.
 Phoebe:So what happens to the old guys?
 Phoebe:Why do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her as this haunty demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey’s shoulder as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)
 Phoebe:(running up carrying a tree) Wait wait wait wait wait! No no you don’t want that one. No you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)
 Phoebe:Okay but that’s why you have to buy it so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him Joey

 Phoebe:All right yknow what nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry I’m sorry I didn’t mean to get so emotional I guess it’s just the holidays it’s hard.
 Phoebe:Oh I wasn’t even thinking about that.
 Phoebe:This is the worst Christmas ever.
 Phoebe:Oh! Oh my God!
 Phoebe:You saved them! You guys! Oh God you’re the best!
 Phoebe:Oh God bless us everyone.

 Phoebe:Okay don’t give me a reason to get mad okay
 Phoebe:No look I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it and you just you big fat did it anyway. God yknow what I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.
 Phoebe:Okay yknow what you have to choose. All right if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then okay you can have Smelly Cat but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?
 Phoebe:Yeah. I actually am yeah. Yknow life-life’s gonna had you all kinds of stuff yknow you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?

 Phoebe:Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Except for yknow when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.

 Phoebe:They have the best stuff in there.

 Phoebe:Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
 Phoebe:Was it not pain-free?
 Phoebe:Huh well the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.
 Phoebe:(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!

 Phoebe:They’ve been quiet for a long time.
 Phoebe:Oh come on they can be in the same room.
 Phoebe:Why? What happened now?
 Phoebe:Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.
 Phoebe:Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God this is like 60 Minutes okay when when at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then yknow you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
 Phoebe:Yknow I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out and everyone was happy....

This is not fair to Frank (she walks behind them again and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it’s not fair to the babies and yknow what it’s not good home economics.
 Phoebe:Yes. Not out loud.
 Phoebe:Yeah but if I do tell him then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom I can’t. (pause) But you guys can please you gotta talk him out of it.
 Phoebe:Come on you guys you have nothing to lose I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!

 Phoebe:Umm well I I kinda had a little chat with Alice and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together yknow. And you’re gonna see it to one day you really really will.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Okay but.
 Phoebe:Hey Frank. Look okay I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.
 Phoebe:Yeah but not just that.
 Phoebe:None the less.
 Phoebe:That’s right exactly. (sees them) All right it’s a good bye kiss that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay no the important thing is that you see what I’m saying yknow just yknow this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay all right good. (leaves).
 Phoebe:We were out of Doritos.
 Phoebe:Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
 Phoebe:What so what are you gonna tell him?
 Phoebe:Huh.
 Phoebe:Wow. So okay maybe that means that you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
 Phoebe:Okay so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.
 Phoebe:So you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)
 Phoebe:Yknow what you should like you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
 Phoebe:Yeah or or or Mississ-Pete.
 Phoebe:Yeah kinda.

 Phoebe:Oh it’s so great to see you feeling like this!
 Phoebe:Wait am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad in a way.
 Phoebe:Wow a house for dolls that is so cool! When I was kid I had a barrel.
 Phoebe:No just a barrel.
 Phoebe:Really?! Really?!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.
 Phoebe:So I’m here ready to play.
 Phoebe:I brought a bunch of stuff for the house so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)
 Phoebe:That’s a dog every house should have a dog.
 Phoebe:Well maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
 Phoebe:No no that’s the ghost for the attic.
 Phoebe:Well nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
 Phoebe:Okay obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.
 Phoebe:(holding a dinosaur) Okay dinosaur attack!! Quick everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
 Phoebe:Okay (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.
 Phoebe:The little ones do.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Look everybody look at my new dollhouse!!
 Phoebe:Look look! (She lifts up the roof and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)
 Phoebe:Oh okay it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)
 Phoebe:The Licorice Room you can eat all the furniture. And when guests come over they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
 Phoebe:Hey does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)
 Phoebe:Watch watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)
 Phoebe:And and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!
 Phoebe:All right. Did everyone get out okay?

 Phoebe:Yeah! Okay here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)
 Phoebe:Oh my God are you guys okay?
 Phoebe:Umm oh about three months.
 Phoebe:Whoa-whoa-whoa you guys do you know anything about chicks?
 Phoebe:Okay well they are a huge responsibility especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food and lot’s and lot’s of love.
 Phoebe:(to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting you went to Japan made up a woman.
 Phoebe:I’m just saying this woman I mean she’s fictitious. No?
 Phoebe:‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together maybe something might happen and...
 Phoebe:Yeah no I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
 Phoebe:Absolutely oh I promise. Tell her what?
 Phoebe:No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive but my memory sucks.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Ohh Monica I am so excited for you.
 Phoebe:Ooh I have to tell you something.
 Phoebe:But I can’t tell you.
 Phoebe:Well sure in a perfect world. But no I promised I wouldn’t tell and I swore to like all my gods.

 Phoebe:No! Rachel that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow if I don’t get through they’re not gonna fix my crappy broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!
 Phoebe:Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?
 Phoebe:Thanks!
 Phoebe:Okay. (on phone) Ooh I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here.

 Phoebe:No no no oh no-no-no it’s has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers every one. (Finds the number) Yeah every big Utah-based company has one.
 Phoebe:Sorry I’m so sorry I will pay you back.
 Phoebe:Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down breaking it) Oh-oh!

 Phoebe:Great! Okay good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)
 Phoebe:Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
 Phoebe:(to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.
 Phoebe:Yeah she was bald she’s not now.
 Phoebe:I don’t know I hardly ever say that about people.
 Phoebe:Well I’m sorry I thought you said it was okay.
 Phoebe:Well maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.
 Phoebe:Oh no Bonnie’s the best!
 Phoebe:So Ross how umm how did it go with Bonnie?
 Phoebe:Ohh that’s too bad!
 Phoebe:Yeah yknow what there are other fish in the sea.
 Phoebe:Okay I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
 Phoebe:Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant or inside his shower drain?
 Phoebe:No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!
 Phoebe:(looking in the window) Right oh yeah. Wow oh it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.
 Phoebe:Oh no! That really is nothing she is very sexually aggressive.
 Phoebe:You said it was okay!
 Phoebe:What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
 Phoebe:Okay first of all breathe. Second of all I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?
 Phoebe:Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?
 Phoebe:So?
 Phoebe:(sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.
 Phoebe:Oh we killed them all.
 Phoebe:Wait if that’s his favourite area why is he being so mean to it?
 Phoebe:(entering hurridly) Hey you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.
 Phoebe:Yknow what that means?
 Phoebe:No-no that’s not that’s not me Phoebe that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook they were like B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.
 Phoebe:I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
 Phoebe:So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.
 Phoebe:Oh I am having the best karma this week. First I find this woman who knew my parents and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
 Phoebe:Oh I wasn’t talking about his karma.
 Phoebe:And this time they’ve ganged up to form one giant super hat.
 Phoebe:Oy!!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah Bob said there might be flood damage.

 Phoebe:Oh so how are we doing?
 Phoebe:I’m kind caring and sweet. What’s Monica like?
 Phoebe:Ohh I think she knows where my Dad is.
 Phoebe:She was acting she was pretending like she hasn’t heard from him on years but I found this picture on her fridge and look (shows Monica)! Isn’t this what he would look like now?
 Phoebe:I don’t know but we’re having dinner tomorrow night so I figured she’s gonna tell me then. Yknow maybe she just wanted to give him time to buy me presents I don’t know! So you’re all bored?
 Phoebe:All right I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone and you whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do and we have to do it.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh yknow we could just do this. (She stops at Chandler)
 Phoebe:Monica if you get five cool points you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn’t happened yet but we’re all very excited.
 Phoebe:Come on take ‘em off!!
 Phoebe:Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.
 Phoebe:After he passed out we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
 Phoebe:She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
 Phoebe:Yeah she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s avoiding me she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is. She knows and she won’t tell me.
 Phoebe:Yeah well don’t “Aww Pheebs that sucks!” me yet. (she starts to leave)
 Phoebe:Well she’s out of town so there’s gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
 Phoebe:Well are any of those people here?!
 Phoebe:Okay look I-I-I do something nice okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her ice trays.
 Phoebe:Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely inside and the window slams shut.) Oh shhh!
 Phoebe:No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!
 Phoebe:I’m sorry.
 Phoebe:I-I came to fill your ice cube trays.
 Phoebe:Umm okay okay look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay because I know that this is my Father. Yeah this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise you’re just mean! (pause) So just tell me the truth!
 Phoebe:My Father is Chuck Magioni?
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Heh?
 Phoebe:Ehh?
 Phoebe:I-I mean I well I think I can figure it out. I guess yknow I was born and everyone started lying their asses off!
 Phoebe:How close?
 Phoebe:I don’t even know how that would work!
 Phoebe:(interrupting) I’m not asking!
 Phoebe:Yeah. Let’s see my had Mom killed herself and my Dad had run off and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
 Phoebe:Yeah well everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And yknow you had 29 years to find that out but you didn’t even try! Yknow what you walked out on me and I’m just I’m gonna do the same thing to you.
 Phoebe:I don’t ever want to see you again!

 Phoebe:Well umm my Mom’s friend Phoebe is actually my birth Mom.
 Phoebe:Oh my new Mom who-who’s a big fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)

 Phoebe:Okay I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.
 Phoebe:(to the person that answered the door) Hi Ursula.
 Phoebe:Okay well umm I know that we haven’t talked in a long time but umm okay our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
 Phoebe:(shocked) You know her?!
 Phoebe:There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well do you still have it?
 Phoebe:I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!
 Phoebe:I umm shut up!
 Phoebe:(reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!
 Phoebe:Noooo!!
 Phoebe:No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.
 Phoebe:(singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you thank you. Ohh and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered and to her) Except for you. You go away.
 Phoebe:Okay bye.
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:But it’s not like we’re losing anything. Yknow?
 Phoebe:It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
 Phoebe:I-I like pizza!
 Phoebe:Oh my God so do I!
 Phoebe:Wait-wait-wait wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh well! But umm still I’m-I’m mad at you.
 Phoebe:Well umm do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.
 Phoebe:All right stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.
 Phoebe:(screaming angrily) ...DUMB DRUNKEN BITCH!!! (applause) (happily) Thank you thanks.
 Phoebe:Oh my God you guys are selling the entertainment center?
 Phoebe:Yeah I actually don’t know...
 Phoebe:Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on you! (goes over and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) Oh my God.
 Phoebe:Nothing. Nothing.
 Phoebe:I just I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
 Phoebe:No no-no she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily the one who killed herself.
 Phoebe:No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all okay there’s the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay and for another how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth in an “Oh my God.” gesture) Oh I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!
 Phoebe:(is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
 Phoebe:Well I’m not sure. I mean I guess until she yknow gets used to the fact that there’s yknow a new mom. Yknow I think she’s worried that yknow she’s gonna she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat in a funny voice) Well that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay I have to return a call in the other room.
 Phoebe:Well I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)
 Phoebe:(entering with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:So great. Oh we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
 Phoebe:I just feel so uhh.....
 Phoebe:Oh yeah your microwave. The stereo.
 Phoebe:Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!
 Phoebe:Ohh. Um-hmm. But yknow she choose to find me. I mean I have to respect her decision. Right?
 Phoebe:(she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross how many parents have you lost?
 Phoebe:Okay then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:I think she would like that.
 Phoebe:Thank you. We both forgive you.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay listen umm Mom I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.
 Phoebe:Come on Mom I’ll take you home.

 Phoebe:Oh please somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!
 Phoebe:Oh my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.
 Phoebe:Oh no it is forbidden! No-no Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.
 Phoebe:No I made myself take an oath. Yeah no fooling around with clients and umm always be prepared. Yeah that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts but it just makes good sense.
 Phoebe:No I can handle it. No I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)

 Phoebe:Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!

 Phoebe:On the touchy.
 Phoebe:No I know! I-I’m sorry but the moment I touch him I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new dirty one.

 Phoebe:There you go thats the spirit! Okay! Now if you need money I will lend you money but just get moving!
 Phoebe:Okay! Its worth it if it will get you moving. You havent worked in months.
 Phoebe:Yes but Im doing this.
 Phoebe:Ooo a crossword! Can I help?
 Phoebe:Fine. But you cant help me develop my new universal language.
 Phoebe:Mon! Im so happy for you!

 Phoebe:Yes. Did you settle the bill?
 Phoebe:Oh look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)
 Phoebe:Oh all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
 Phoebe:But Mon you have to get our money!
 Phoebe:I know its tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mothers funeral was?
 Phoebe:Pay the caterer! Look Ive had a lot of jobs okay and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. Its either you know that massage wasnt long enough or I dont recognize any of those songs or you know these sombreros arent big enough. Bad little white girl!
 Phoebe:Well it seems like there werent any tears til you showed her the bill.
 Phoebe:She seems fine now.
 Phoebe:You didnt get the money did you?
 Phoebe:No! Hey were not leaving until we get paid! I dont know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey widow?
 Phoebe:Okay Widow!
 Phoebe:Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um clearly this is a very very hard time for you. Um but um we provided a service and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service and um we are not leaving here until were paid every penny. Cause you know what lady? Were part time caterers and we have no place else to go.
 Phoebe:Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)
 Phoebe:Uh... yay!
 Phoebe:Yeah. Im a hard ass.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
 Phoebe:Okay!
 Phoebe:Yeah. Oh! Itll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
 Phoebe:Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
 Phoebe:(singing) Little tiny Tarzan swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease… Darn it! Now I don’t know who to get to the next verse.
 Phoebe:Yeah ooh I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’
 Phoebe:Oh yeah that’s right the keyboards huh?
 Phoebe:I wanna hear The Sound.
 Phoebe:Come on play that funky music white boy.
 Phoebe:Wow it was so—wow!
 Phoebe:What are you guys talking about I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh plus it’s just it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.
 Phoebe:(pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
 Phoebe:Oh no I’m not playing tonight.
 Phoebe:I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
 Phoebe:Oh my God he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
 Phoebe:You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)
 Phoebe:Hey! You were really great! You were really really great!
 Phoebe:Well kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really yknow okay and upbeat about it I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…
 Phoebe:Oh no. No-no-no don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
 Phoebe:Does Joey know?
 Phoebe:I think maybe yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah! No that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
 Phoebe:Oh my God he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.
 Phoebe:After that? Yeah! No I mean if I can help.
 Phoebe:Look everyone it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!
 Phoebe:Speaking of Christmas umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money umm this year maybe we could do secret Santa and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.
 Phoebe:I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
 Phoebe:Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on let’s trade!
 Phoebe:Ohh.
 Phoebe:You don’t have to do that Ross and Joey aren’t here you can watch the parade if you want.
 Phoebe:God what happened?!
 Phoebe:Open it up let me see.
 Phoebe:Ooh God it looks bad.
 Phoebe:Honey you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?
 Phoebe:(on phone) Hi! Yeah I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye and is um is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He’s out of town but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
 Phoebe:Yes! She’s very excited about that.
 Phoebe:This is so cool ‘til Monica gets back it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter and then decides to add it to the dish.)
 Phoebe:Okay get out of my kitchen!
 Phoebe:All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
 Phoebe:Yeah I can see where I’d be your best shot but no. I’m sorry but I think it’s twisted.
 Phoebe:Yeah but Monica do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase That’s not how your dad used to do it.
 Phoebe:Oh I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)
 Phoebe:Oh he-he can’t talk right now.
 Phoebe:He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
 Phoebe:They were threefold.
 Phoebe:Oh she sees him! Oh they’re hugging!
 Phoebe:Oh there they are!

 Phoebe:He just got a divorce right?
 Phoebe:So he’s probably really nervous around women yknow? Maybe you just have to make the first move.
 Phoebe:(shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!

 Phoebe:Oh please!
 Phoebe:I’ve never done that.

 Phoebe:(angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat y’know? And I got nauseous.
 Phoebe:Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.

 Phoebe:Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder cold blooded murder.
 Phoebe:I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
 Phoebe:Yeah totally!
 Phoebe:Yeah but at what cost? Six more months three meals a day I’m gonna eat like y’know millions of cows.

 Phoebe:No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?
 Phoebe:You can’t give up on your dream.
 Phoebe:Hey.

 Phoebe:(entering carrying a case) Ooh good you’re hear! Okay.
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Oh this well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now I know what you’re thinking…

 Phoebe:No-no I know that but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
 Phoebe:My Saturn dealership.
 Phoebe:Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!
 Phoebe:I’m telling it! I’m telling it!
 Phoebe:Okay. You know how people need transportation but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two okay I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van bolt the table in the back and you know what I’ve got?
 Phoebe:No! Think about it it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax it’s…
 Phoebe:The name was my favourite part!
 Phoebe:YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.
 Phoebe:Hey tell him about Relaxi-Taxi and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.
 Phoebe:Oh that is better.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:(not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!

 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a book) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like y’know strong and confident y’know? Like-like Exxon.
 Phoebe:No I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk but I like the idea of a name starting with The.
 Phoebe:Well I I like the idea of naming him after someone I love and Joey and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But all right I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.
 Phoebe:God Susan is so fun!
 Phoebe:Yeah I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.
 Phoebe:No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
 Phoebe:Well it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk y’know…
 Phoebe:So I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
 Phoebe:Well how about a compromise then okay? What if it’s like y’know Chanoey?
 Phoebe:All right so what are we supposed to call you?
 Phoebe:Umm Gene.
 Phoebe:Bye Gene.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wow Carol really messed you up!
 Phoebe:Yeah she turned you into this-this-this untrusting crazy jealous sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right so I don’t know what sycophant means but the rest is right.
 Phoebe:All right all right so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting then ’94 hit Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
 Phoebe:Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.
 Phoebe:Drum roll.
 Phoebe:You’re actually going through with this?
 Phoebe:You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes (To Joey) I’m I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey but eh so I’m-I’m I’m gonna I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.

 Phoebe:Oh yeah! You like ‘em? I just I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who’s been naughty and who’s been nice.) See these names are good and these names are bad. (Finally she figures it out.) Ohh.
 Phoebe:I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.
 Phoebe:Boy! I didn’t see that coming!

 Phoebe:(opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay it was my idea but I don’t feel good about it.
 Phoebe:That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest no one would have had to move at all.
 Phoebe:Okay scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf it’s just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What? Oh are you pregnant too?!
 Phoebe:Hey!

 Phoebe:Hey!! Get your ass back here Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in scared.)
 Phoebe:I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great! (Really excited) A party! (Really really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don’t know why.
 Phoebe:What the hell is this?! What did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right what’s my next present?!
 Phoebe:Hi guys.
 Phoebe:I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones y’know.
 Phoebe:Anyway I just wanted to say thank you it was just it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)
 Phoebe:Good. Y’know—no-no okay it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately so what’s happening with you?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
 Phoebe:Well let’s see it’s not. Really like that. Because you see that was an actual problem and uh yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…
 Phoebe:Alrighty here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)
 Phoebe:(sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh thanks.
 Phoebe:(sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
 Phoebe:Oh! No I-I think I just had a contraction.
 Phoebe:Yeah I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago and now I know that was definitely one.
 Phoebe:No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that that can happen near the end just somebody get the book.
 Phoebe:Well do you see any babies?
 Phoebe:Okay I guess. I mean… I don’t know it’s just I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.
 Phoebe:I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re when you’re done with the pregnant thing y’know then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know sitting around in my leather pants drinking Tequila.
 Phoebe:Okay that’s even sadder. Look I know I know what I got myself into it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like it’s like I know them y’know I mean-I mean it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.

 Phoebe:Well I think I can help you get over him.
 Phoebe:Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
 Phoebe:And a small piece of chocolate.

 Phoebe:Okay. Umm before we get started I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross I think he’s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay now close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease it’s—uck! Hah?
 Phoebe:Okay this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm let’s try some uh aversion therapy.

 Phoebe:Happy birthday!
 Phoebe:I know it is.
 Phoebe:Can I tell you a little secret?
 Phoebe:I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)
 Phoebe:Why not?! Maybe I can you dont know!
 Phoebe:Maybe not! Yknow? Seriously three babies are a handful maybe theyre yknow looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didnt ask! Yknow?
 Phoebe:Oh just ask him!
 Phoebe:I cant ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All Im saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just yknow feel him out!
 Phoebe:Youre right.
 Phoebe:Tell him its for you.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) So did you ask him?
 Phoebe:Well Im kinda on a clock here.
 Phoebe:Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Okay doctor says any minute now.
 Phoebe:Sorry Frank Im kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
 Phoebe:Oo this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
 Phoebe:What is that?
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
 Phoebe:Which one do you have?
 Phoebe:But umm I mean did you talk to them about yknow…
 Phoebe:Oh. It was a long shot. Hey you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
 Phoebe:So here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing Id ever have to do but they were wrong this is. Oh I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay Ill settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alices sister has a pool but you lived in me. Okay so were cool. Yeah were gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well if youre gonna cry. (She starts crying.)
 Phoebe:I know.
 Phoebe:Yeah. You wont be able to take it.
 Phoebe:Theyre gonna call her Chandler.
 Phoebe:Works on you.
 Phoebe:Ugh PBS!
 Phoebe:Ugh whats right with them?
 Phoebe:Okay cause right after my mom killed herself I was just in this really bad place yknow personally. So I just thought that itd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
 Phoebe:All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didnt have keys!
 Phoebe:This isnt a good deed you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
 Phoebe:What-what are you talking about?!
 Phoebe:Yeah. So?
 Phoebe:Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
 Phoebe:Yeah its… Yknow theres—no you may not!
 Phoebe:Are you calling me selfish?!
 Phoebe:Im gonna find a selfless good dead. Im gonna beat you you evil genius.
 Phoebe:Hey Joey when you said the deal with Santa Clause you meant?
 Phoebe:Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
 Phoebe:I cannot believe I cant find a selfless good deed! Yknow that old guy that lives next to me? Well I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
 Phoebe:I will find a selfless good deed! Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
 Phoebe:Ooh-ohh!
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah but youve known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
 Phoebe:(on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
 Phoebe:Well it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
 Phoebe:(Thinks for a moment.) Aw dammit! (Slams the phone down.)
 Phoebe:Ooh its not a toy.
 Phoebe:(on phone) Hi Joey.
 Phoebe:I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
 Phoebe:Oh Im still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids whos moms didnt kill themselves so by supporting them Im doing a good thing but Im not happy about it. So there a selfless good deed.
 Phoebe:No it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
 Phoebe:Yeah not the one I had my eye on.
 Phoebe:Oh look-look Joeys on TV! Isnt that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore its selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
 Phoebe:Oh weird Chandler just told us hes got a conference there!
 Phoebe:Wait a minute! So when Emily comes youre just youre not gonna see Rachel anymore?
 Phoebe:Yeah thats better than my way.
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) Can you hear anything?
 Phoebe:Ooh Madlibs mine! (Grabs it.)
 Phoebe:I know its le poo right now but itll get better.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
 Phoebe:Ehh!!
 Phoebe:Come where?
 Phoebe:Okay but try and get Joey too.
 Phoebe:Oh sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his back.) Forever.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh hey Monica I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
 Phoebe:Were so stupid! Do you know whats going on in there? Theyre trying to take Joey!
 Phoebe:The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say Hi Phoebe!
 Phoebe:Count for what?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yeah my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didnt even have a family and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
 Phoebe:Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that its a fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)
 Phoebe:Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesnt she know me but at all! Plus I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvies husband said someone elses name in bed she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
 Phoebe:Oh I hate this. Everythings changing.
 Phoebe:I dont know what Im gonna do about this coat.
 Phoebe:That might work! (She gives him the coat.)
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:So listen you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
 Phoebe:He says that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm yknow bring in the next person I know who dies.
 Phoebe:This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay so to you death is fashion?! Thats really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Heres Phoebe umm sporting uh yknow cutting edge hairy carcass from yknow the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the mirror.) Cause I do.
 Phoebe:Nooo!!
 Phoebe:I think hes right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
 Phoebe:Oh I know.
 Phoebe:All right I cant sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on her fur coat.)
 Phoebe:Well Ive been reading up and for your information minks are not very nice. Okay I admit it! I love this coat! Okay I—its the best thing Ive ever had wrapped around me including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
 Phoebe:Are you still mad at us?
 Phoebe:Oh good! Because we have an Im sorry song.
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) Youre kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play but is stopped by…)
 Phoebe:Okay now youre just taking lines right out of the song!
 Phoebe:Yes! Exactly! And thats why…
 Phoebe:Okay lets get some perspective people; its not like Im wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
 Phoebe:Oh God I really missed that fat bastard!
 Phoebe:Hi Emily!
 Phoebe:Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
 Phoebe:(to the squirrel) Okay stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay theyre mean! And they hate squirrels! And yknow okay most of these probably wanted to be coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right fine now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here. (She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? Im cold!
 Phoebe:Umm do health inspectors work on commission?
 Phoebe:Its okay to laugh right?
 Phoebe:Okay. (She laughs harder.)
 Phoebe:Yum-my!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah! Id let him check out my kitchen floors.
 Phoebe:Hey you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that shed have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
 Phoebe:Yeah but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
 Phoebe:Okay she would love that! Yknow cause you know all the clean places to eat.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Hes so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
 Phoebe:(smiles) Show me the badge again.
 Phoebe:Shiny.
 Phoebe:(laughing) You are just nonstop!
 Phoebe:Why?!
 Phoebe:(awed) You have the power to do that?
 Phoebe:(excited) Shut it down.
 Phoebe:Oh I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
 Phoebe:Hey guys you know what Larry would say? He would say See you ladle. (Laughs.)
 Phoebe:Ooh absolutely!
 Phoebe:Ooh I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So no.
 Phoebe:Enh. Sure!
 Phoebe:Oh no-no this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today cause I was thirsty for milk yknow. (She takes a swig of it but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay lets go!
 Phoebe:Okay stop! Larry okay cant you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Yknow I mean it was really exciting at first but now its like okay so where are we gonna eat ever?
 Phoebe:Thank you. (To Gunther whos standing there frozen) Okay go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now if after dinner you still really need to bust someone I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
 Phoebe:Does anyone wanna watch TV?
 Phoebe:Monica your remote doesnt work.
 Phoebe:Oh. Aw forget it.
 Phoebe:Wow! See and I didnt think youd be able to come up with anything.
 Phoebe:I dont know about that. Ive got one thats worse.
 Phoebe:Oh did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes mines worse!
 Phoebe:Oh this life! Oh okay no Chandlers is worse.
 Phoebe:Of course you dont sweetie. Youre brand new.
 Phoebe:Oh no I know! I know! Its the one where Joey got Monicas turkey stuck on his head!
 Phoebe:(surprised) Hello?
 Phoebe:Joey? Whats going on?
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Monicas gonna totally freak out!
 Phoebe:Well of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:No its not supposed to be funny its supposed to be scary.
 Phoebe:All right hold on! Okay lets just all think.
 Phoebe:Oh wait! That cant be the one Rachels talking about. She didnt even know that happened. So which one was it?
 Phoebe:Oh I cant believe you called her fat.
 Phoebe:Oh no I have the cutest Christmas story!
 Phoebe:Fine all right mine had a dwarf that got broke in half but yknow whatever.
 Phoebe:What am I sitting on?
 Phoebe:(taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!
 Phoebe:Umm Wethering Heights. Im taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Well I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Yknow and this time I thought Id go for something yknow a little more intellectual with a less painful final exam.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Ooh you should come with me! Oh yeah then Id have someone to sit with!
 Phoebe:Yeah! Okay—ooh but are you going to have time to read it?
 Phoebe:This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh I have to finish.
 Phoebe:Okay look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
 Phoebe:Okay this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and the gang reads it.)
 Phoebe:Someday Ill tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
 Phoebe:Well he stabbed me first!!
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:I thought you said you read it in high school.
 Phoebe:Okay umm its this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliffs character. I totally get symbolism.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!
 Phoebe:Well how would you know?! You didnt even read it!
 Phoebe:I think that uh yours is a question with many answers.
 Phoebe:Would you care to venture one?
 Phoebe:Are you just repeating what Im saying?
 Phoebe:Okay then.
 Phoebe:Yeah but why didnt you just say that you didnt read the book?!
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:You didnt read this one either?!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:No! You shouldve read it yourself!
 Phoebe:Fine! Okay all right so Jane Eyre first of all youd think shes a woman but shes not. Shes a cyborg.
 Phoebe:Yeah this book was light years ahead of its time.
 Phoebe:Umm Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
 Phoebe:(smiling) Im sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
 Phoebe:Well I snapped! Okay? You werent taking the class seriously.
 Phoebe:Well yeah! Fun is good but yknow I also wanted to learn. Yknow people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
 Phoebe:All right wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Lets give our friend Joey a chance to explain why hes such a big pervert!
 Phoebe:Whats going on?
 Phoebe:So thats why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
 Phoebe:I really thought you making a good point. I mean yknow until you got cut off.
 Phoebe:I dont know! I didnt come with her!
 Phoebe:Hey you guys guess what?
 Phoebe:Ohh you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations.
 Phoebe:(Excitedly) Yeah I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean last year I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year I’m going to do the whole city.
 Phoebe:Ohh they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie but I’m the only one who can sing Merry Christmas in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.
 Phoebe:Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo and Merry Christmas. (A man put some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Heres some joy. (She waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well its going okay.
 Phoebe:Oh thanks!
 Phoebe:Wow!
 Phoebe:Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
 Phoebe:Just get your nails done?
 Phoebe:Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays heres your joy. (She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)
 Phoebe:Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
 Phoebe:Wait you cant take the money out.
 Phoebe:But cant you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
 Phoebe:Okay Seasons Greetings and everything but still…
 Phoebe:Oh Im going to give him something else besides joy just… (She scowls at him.)
 Phoebe:Thank you Happy Holidays.
 Phoebe:Now thats trash. Young lady you cant… (The lady ignores her and walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady she donated trash!
 Phoebe:Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charitys on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) Its nine oclock in the morning!
 Phoebe:Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldnt believe what people put in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay does this look like a garbage can to you?
 Phoebe:Does it look like an ashtray?
 Phoebe:Does it look like a urinal?
 Phoebe:Well yeah! But Im not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
 Phoebe:Yeah Im gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but yknow what? I cant go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldnt be friends with you guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)
 Phoebe:Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute open up your hand; let me take a look. (The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the lint away.) Whats this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)
 Phoebe:Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought I told you to get outta here!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:That chick cant handle my corner.
 Phoebe:Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (The same old lady walks by again.) All right Ill give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. (The old lady.)
 Phoebe:Its so obvious why doesnt he just ask?
 Phoebe:You too!
 Phoebe:Ooh! Thats a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
 Phoebe:Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
 Phoebe:Really?! How come?
 Phoebe:Do you want me to teach you? Im a great teacher.
 Phoebe:Well I taught me and I love me.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh this must be killing you.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no you dont touch the guitar! First you learn here (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the guitar.)
 Phoebe:Okay lesson one chords. Now I dont know the actual names of the chords but umm I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while Im doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note For this one youll have to use your imagination cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them youll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then this is Bear Claw. Okay umm Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)
 Phoebe:Hey everybody Rachel was so good today. She didnt gossip at all.
 Phoebe:Ooh you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)
 Phoebe:Did you did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
 Phoebe:Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings. Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
 Phoebe:Then dont touch one!!
 Phoebe:Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord in fact he does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph did you even study at all last night?
 Phoebe:Then do Iceberg!
 Phoebe:G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? (Joey doesnt answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God!
 Phoebe:No but youre questioning my method!
 Phoebe:Yknow none of my other student thought I was stupid.
 Phoebe:Yeah well yknow maybe you just need to try a little harder!
 Phoebe:Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But dont come crying to me when everyones sick and tired of hearing you play Bad Bad Leroy Brown!!
 Phoebe:Oh fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)
 Phoebe:No I cant talk to you! I dont have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh!
 Phoebe:No!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Okay Im gonna go too. Im gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough someones bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
 Phoebe:Bye! (She exits leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)
 Phoebe:Hey! Its raining. I dont want to fly in the rain. So…
 Phoebe:Thats weird. (Pause.) I bet theyre doing it.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way you and Emily are in the past and you cant be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
 Phoebe:Exactly! Because its in the past!
 Phoebe:Okay then what happened?
 Phoebe:(gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) Youll get your turn!
 Phoebe:Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This is not over!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What were you doing?
 Phoebe:Oh nobodys judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)
 Phoebe:You two will have very hairy children.
 Phoebe:So are you actually gonna see her again?

 Phoebe:Yeah her first day on a new spiritual plane and shes gonna come to the coffeehouse!
 Phoebe:Its okay. Actually yknow what its kinda cool. Cause its like yknow one life ends and another begins.
 Phoebe:Well umm okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
 Phoebe:It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; Okay dear you go get the eggs and Im gonna get the yogurt and well meet at the checkout counter. And yknow what? We will meet at the checkout counter.

 Phoebe:Come on you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? Hes gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
 Phoebe:Well I said I told him yknow that I was the executor person of Francis will and that I needed to talk to him so Im gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
 Phoebe:All right well I just cant think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
 Phoebe:All right Id better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
 Phoebe:Umm no not at first cause I-I dont want to freak him out
 Phoebe:Yknow its funny youd think Id be angry. I mean youd think Id wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately Im past it.
 Phoebe:All right.
 Phoebe:Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
 Phoebe:As a masseuse and a human Im begging you never do that to anyone!
 Phoebe:(seeing the look on Chandlers face) He-he does not like it! He hates it! Hes in pain!
 Phoebe:Umm thank you for meeting with me.
 Phoebe:Come sit. (Hes hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on the arm of the couch.) Umm all righty before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.

 Phoebe:17 years ago.
 Phoebe:Well Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe (pause) is on this couch.
 Phoebe:Yep lipstick and a daughter big day for you!

 Phoebe:Oh! Oh I cant believe it! I mean I think its great! For him. She might be able to do better.
 Phoebe:Okay so now they know that you know and they dont know that Rachel knows?
 Phoebe:Or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
 Phoebe:Well yknow every time that they say that like theyre doing laundry well just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
 Phoebe:No! You dont have to do anything! Just dont tell them that we know!
 Phoebe:Well you could use your position yknow as the roommate.
 Phoebe:And then. I would use yknow the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
 Phoebe:Okay watch learn and dont eat my cookie.
 Phoebe:Hey! Ooh wow that jacket looks great on you!
 Phoebe:(feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
 Phoebe:Well if you really wanna know Im—Oh! I cant tell you this.
 Phoebe:Well actually youre the one person I cant tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
 Phoebe:I think its just yknow that I havent been with a guy in so long and how sometimes youre looking for something and you just don’t even see that its right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no have I said to much? Well its just something to think about. I know I will.
 Phoebe:I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
 Phoebe:But theres a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
 Phoebe:Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
 Phoebe:Yeah why dont you just find another apartment?
 Phoebe:He broke that.
 Phoebe:I wouldnt bring that up it would probably just bum him out.
 Phoebe:(in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.
 Phoebe:Eh?
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:Ill have to get back to you on that. Okay bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!

 Phoebe:So here we are. Nervous?
 Phoebe:No I want this to happen.
 Phoebe:Maybe maybe Ill dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance thats silly at the same time.)
 Phoebe:Thanks! Yknow that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:No. No! Its just yknow first I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
 Phoebe:Hes not backing down. He went to get lotion.

 Phoebe:Here it comes. Our first kiss.
 Phoebe:And why not?!
 Phoebe:Youre-youre what?!

 Phoebe:Yeah uh-huh a 100 dollars.
 Phoebe:Yeah but they didnt ask me! Yknow? This way Im just yknow the exotic generous stranger. Thats always fun to be.
 Phoebe:No Im not. No! If anything Im making you look better! Theyll see you talking to me and thats--Im a hit!
 Phoebe:Hey!

 Phoebe:Ooh. (Turns to him.)
 Phoebe:No! No! Im talking you up to people. Just give it a little time all right? Relax get something to eat! Okay?
 Phoebe:Oh I was telling them about you and Emily. Yknow try to get some sympathy.
 Phoebe:But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
 Phoebe:Yeah I think I told it wrong. Yknow we should talk about that because I dont totally understand what happened there.
 Phoebe:Oh okay see? Things are looking up already!
 Phoebe:All right everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you dont like him! He-he didnt give you any money he raised his own hand when I asked Who hear likes Ross and hes wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-Ill be honest with you guys when I first met Ross I didnt like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that hes really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean all Im saying is dont judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean I like all you guys now but when I first meet you yknow Kurt I thought yknow abrasive drunk umm Lola mind numbingly stupid! And okay you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman whore a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So I think you all know what I mean.
 Phoebe:Obviously I didnt think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
 Phoebe:Aw and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
 Phoebe:All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel! (Donates it.) How much more do we need?
 Phoebe:Okay dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh my God this is a police badge!
 Phoebe:Yeah I should probably take it back. Ooh but you know what? While Im at the police station I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in hope.)
 Phoebe:Oh. Oh! Maam? Excuse me maam?
 Phoebe:You cant put your cigarette out on a tree!
 Phoebe:No but you shouldnt! Dont ever do that again.
 Phoebe:Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
 Phoebe:Yeah thats right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book em.
 Phoebe:Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer you apologize to the tree.
 Phoebe:You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!
 Phoebe:Okay cancel backup! Cancel backup!
 Phoebe:…so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And Im all Buffay Homicide. (Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!
 Phoebe:I know but Im having so much fun doing good deeds.
 Phoebe:You could get arrested right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at her.) All right yeah I gotta take it back. Im totally drunk with power. (She heads for the door just as Joey enters.)
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Hey.
 Phoebe:Excuse me is this your car?
 Phoebe:Well I dont think its very nice of you to park here yknow youre blocking the entrance.
 Phoebe:Well its a problem for me which means its a problem for you cause Im a cop. (Shows the badge.)

 Phoebe:I-I sure will take care. (Starts walking off.)

 Phoebe:Ooh God its him! Its that cop! God I cant believe it! He found me!
 Phoebe:Well if Im going down Im taking you (Points at all of them) with me. (They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? Thats one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay you can arrest me. Fine. But youll never make it stick and you know it!

 Phoebe:No but it is fast. Isnt it?
 Phoebe:No I like him a lot but I dont think Im ready for this!
 Phoebe:I dont know. Ill just handle it—Ill ask you to talk to him!
 Phoebe:Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him make him scared like you! Make him a…man!
 Phoebe:Hmm did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you cant even do that right! God!
 Phoebe:Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of here good for nothing.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)
 Phoebe:Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm.
 Phoebe:No thats not true. If youre not moving forward youre just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:That is so sweet. But dont you think its a little too soon? I mean theres so much we dont know about each other.
 Phoebe:I just—I dont want us to jump into something were not ready for.
 Phoebe:I really dont want to mess up what we have. Im just—Im worried its gonna be a big mistake.

 Phoebe:I know Im so excited!
 Phoebe:Well youre not more excited than I am! No way! Im the most excited!
 Phoebe:Okay yeah Ill see you later! Dont forget about the moving in!
 Phoebe:I couldnt tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe itll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus think of all the money Ill save on stamps.
 Phoebe:No I just heard when people live together they split the cost of stamps. Dont they?
 Phoebe:Oh Im sorry the oven mitts really freaked me out.
 Phoebe:No nothing.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:No as soon as something opens up well move right in. Unless it doesnt have a pool I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)
 Phoebe:Uh-huh!
 Phoebe:(sits down) Yeah I feel great. Cause were moving in together.
 Phoebe:Yeah uh-huh there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?
 Phoebe:Umm yeah! Todays.
 Phoebe:(looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
 Phoebe:Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! (Pause) Im sorry! (Puts her head down.)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Thats so sweet.
 Phoebe:Living with you would make me happy.
 Phoebe:No I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
 Phoebe:Yes. Definitely! Yes! Lets live in an apartment that we both live in! (Hugs him.)
 Phoebe:Oh wait one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! Ive always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms (sees the look on his face) which was never!
 Phoebe:I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! Its such a beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh I can stay here all day.
 Phoebe:We could have breakfast in bed…

 Phoebe:(entering) Oh good youre all up.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah thats over.
 Phoebe:He shot a bird!
 Phoebe:Yeah. Yeah Ill be alright.
 Phoebe:(catches it) Nah I dont feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Ohh give him a kiss for me!
 Phoebe:Bye!
 Phoebe:(after hes gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didnt mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
 Phoebe:Im trying but man that guy can push my buttons!
 Phoebe:Look I dont wanna talk about it. Okay?
 Phoebe:You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
 Phoebe:Uh its a piece of paper and it says Ross on it.
 Phoebe:Ohh-oh chilling!
 Phoebe:Oh wait my grandmothers dead.
 Phoebe:No! No her cab! She probably wont be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
 Phoebe:Oh hey Joey! Whats up?
 Phoebe:Yeah Ive been around.
 Phoebe:Ooh if you take the northern route theres a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay I must protest this Ive lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin on the other hand might be a different story.}
 Phoebe:But on the southern route theres a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
 Phoebe:Oh I know a way that you can decide! All right Im going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
 Phoebe:Good but wait. Okay all right here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
 Phoebe:Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
 Phoebe:Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
 Phoebe:No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
 Phoebe:North route or south route?
 Phoebe:Bamn! There you go! Huh?
 Phoebe:Oh this guy again. (She ignores him.)
 Phoebe:Umm no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a table previously.)
 Phoebe:Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!

 Phoebe:Oh Im sorry. I didnt see you there.
 Phoebe:Well if you dont know I cant help you.
 Phoebe:Well I cant help you.
 Phoebe:Apology accepted.

 Phoebe:Oh no I am mad at you. I know that much. But I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:No that made me feel precious.
 Phoebe:That game should not be played without my supervision.
 Phoebe:Whats in the bag?
 Phoebe:I do!
 Phoebe:Ooh that is definitely Chandler Joey or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!
 Phoebe:Hey dude!
 Phoebe:Oh thats my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks Joey shes having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)
 Phoebe:Okay Joey? Chandlers here he was wondering… (We hear the dial tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay I guess he ran out of change.
 Phoebe:No dont-dont say Im sorry with porn!

 Phoebe:So youre a gladiator! Wow!
 Phoebe:Monica had lunch with Richard.
 Phoebe:Noo! But that wouldve been so cool!
 Phoebe:I love Vegas!
 Phoebe:Thanks.
 Phoebe:Yknow Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! Its only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so sorry.
 Phoebe:So go fix it! Go find Chandler! Hes probably up in your room! Tell him that youre sorry and that you love him.
 Phoebe:Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas number one!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Ohh you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So wheres Monica? Did you guys make up?
 Phoebe:But she just came up here!
 Phoebe:I wonder where she is. That is so weird.

 Phoebe:Yes! Now she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
 Phoebe:Good. (After he leaves she puts on Joeys gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!

 Phoebe:Ohh! You made up!
 Phoebe:Ohh get a room.
 Phoebe:I know. Use it.
 Phoebe:Oh well lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) Thats it! You and me outside!
 Phoebe:Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady your lurking days are over!
 Phoebe:Yeah from now on everyone you lurk Im gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else Im gonna be one step ahead of you every single time! And then Ill be on your ass every hour of every day til Monday because thats when I go home. When do you leave?

 Phoebe:She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)
 Phoebe:How about we talk about this over dinner?
 Phoebe:No! No you cant arrest me! No!! I wont go back! I wont go back to that hell hole!!
 Phoebe:Oh okay. (Walks out.)
 Phoebe:(entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. Im a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks down) Ooh what did I do with my file-a-facts? I mustve left it in conference room B.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! Theyre identical! Now Ive never seen anything like that in the business world.
 Phoebe:No you threw out Phoebe. Im Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
 Phoebe:Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)
 Phoebe:(to her) Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey! (Sees Chandler and Monica standing there.)
 Phoebe:Well maybe you wouldn’t have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!
 Phoebe:What’s the big deal y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.
 Phoebe:Yeah if you get married in Vegas you’re only married in Vegas.
 Phoebe:(shocked) Really?!
 Phoebe:Oh my God!—Eh! Well…
 Phoebe:Oh Joey I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
 Phoebe:What about my cab?
 Phoebe:No Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
 Phoebe:I don’t know it’s such a long trip.
 Phoebe:Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
 Phoebe:All right. Although I don’t think we need one I never stopped loving you.
 Phoebe:Um-hmm yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
 Phoebe:Well you don’t.
 Phoebe:Good! Good! I was just testing you.
 Phoebe:No we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
 Phoebe:Hell I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!
 Phoebe:Oh-oh that’s your thing.
 Phoebe:You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.
 Phoebe:Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk.
 Phoebe:Okay you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!
 Phoebe:Well you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment you greedy sleeper!
 Phoebe:Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
 Phoebe:Sing!!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face) a rapist or a killer or something!
 Phoebe:Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you are you a rapist?!
 Phoebe:Do you like car games?
 Phoebe:I love the license plate game!
 Phoebe:No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the partition.)
 Phoebe:Oh okay.
 Phoebe:And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter so the ball’s pretty much in your court.
 Phoebe:Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!
 Phoebe:You can still sleep at night and stuff.
 Phoebe:Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
 Phoebe:Is it a meatball sub?
 Phoebe:No thanks I’ve already seen one.
 Phoebe:Always.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Always.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:(running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
 Phoebe:Oh there’s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.) Good timing my God huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)
 Phoebe:Oh the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab’s roof and it pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn’t get the annulment?!!
 Phoebe:Ross?!
 Phoebe:Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say Ross Geller Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay Buried Alive.
 Phoebe:So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op woman! Sorry.
 Phoebe:Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
 Phoebe:Hey Rach!
 Phoebe:Sorry mix up. Hey how was the movie?
 Phoebe:Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the roof again and off they go.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:No why?
 Phoebe:(gasps) You’re pregnant!
 Phoebe:Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant what would you name it? Hint Phoebe.
 Phoebe:Guys I’m happy too.
 Phoebe:Wow! Big day huh? People moving in people getting annulled… (Winks at Ross.)
 Phoebe:Hmm something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel what could that be?!
 Phoebe:Ross it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times you’ll still have a life you’ll go on dates…
 Phoebe:Ross you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
 Phoebe:Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here I’ll show you! Come here.
 Phoebe:(to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time but wouldn’t you date him?
 Phoebe:Okay so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?
 Phoebe:Okay what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?
 Phoebe:(interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
 Phoebe:(leaning to him) She said He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. (He glares at her.)
 Phoebe:Well I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
 Phoebe:Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
 Phoebe:Yes and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say Well done! Bravo Meg.
 Phoebe:(to Joey and Chandler) Okay bye!
 Phoebe:So? Did you get the annulment?
 Phoebe:I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
 Phoebe:Yeah complicated ‘cause of the love.
 Phoebe:I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.
 Phoebe:Oh we do but not just yet.
 Phoebe:Okay umm well first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.
 Phoebe:I know. Then I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
 Phoebe:But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.
 Phoebe:I don’t want to go into the whole thing but umm we have words and I kill him.
 Phoebe:Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh what?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Well that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
 Phoebe:My roommate.
 Phoebe:Yes Denise. Denise!
 Phoebe:Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:So what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
 Phoebe:You didn’t tell her did you?
 Phoebe:Of course not because you’re in love with her.
 Phoebe:What do you mean comforted her?
 Phoebe:Ah-ha! A classic sign of love the hug!
 Phoebe:Yeah not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of Ross’s cookie.)
 Phoebe:Okay just tell me this did you or did you not smell her hair?
 Phoebe:Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross you’re a scientist.
 Phoebe:(taking his coffee) Okay whatever you say. But just be careful all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.
 Phoebe:Okay I didn’t understand that but y’know maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
 Phoebe:Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.
 Phoebe:Umm I’m trying to move that pencil. (There’s a pencil lying on the table.)
 Phoebe:It worked!
 Phoebe:Wait no look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) Two bedroom two bath must be non-smoker Satan worshipers okay… Oh yeah but it’s on the ground floor.
 Phoebe:I saw it.
 Phoebe:Umm I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
 Phoebe:I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (Pause) Okay just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so not stupid.
 Phoebe:No. No I won’t. But I should tell you this this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her but he really did and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay that’s a lie.
 Phoebe:(singing) I found you in my bed! 
 Phoebe:Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
 Phoebe:(on the microphone accidentally) Yes.
 Phoebe:Ross I know what you’re thinking.
 Phoebe:That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just you’re very sad.
 Phoebe:What?!!
 Phoebe:No! (Ross’s phone rings.)
 Phoebe:Yeah Professor and Mrs.
 Phoebe:Oh! Yeah y’know you and Ross are still married.
 Phoebe:Just kidding!
 Phoebe:(To Ross) Saved your ass.
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:Well you know that psychic I see?
 Phoebe:Well she told me that I’m gonna die this week so I’m kinda bummed about that.
 Phoebe:Yeah and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
 Phoebe:I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
 Phoebe:No ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine) leans back and starts reading.)
 Phoebe:Oh this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Ugh it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh by the way do you think you could—(Groans hacks and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)
 Phoebe:I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
 Phoebe:Yeah thanks. And listen can you do me a favor? Could you just umm wake me up in a couple hours y’know if you can.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What’s going on?
 Phoebe:Hey! Maybe you’ll die!
 Phoebe:No we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.
 Phoebe:No-no it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Listen to this! My reading was wrong I’m not going die!
 Phoebe:Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!
 Phoebe:Eh better her than me! Hey let’s bake cookies!
 Phoebe:Have you really done this before?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
 Phoebe:(overdoing it) Oh my God!!
 Phoebe:Okay this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
 Phoebe:Another lie. You have a sickness!
 Phoebe:(coming in from the bathroom) Oh good good you guys are here! Listen how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
 Phoebe:Okay well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay and uh by the way they’re not actually puppies they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay see ya! (Exits.)
 Phoebe:(stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!
 Phoebe:What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while I don’t have a roommate.
 Phoebe:Maybe you could be my roommate!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Umm she said she’d be back December 26th.
 Phoebe:(rapidly) I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?
 Phoebe:Na-uh no we are all responsible for our own babies.
 Phoebe:That sounds really great but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
 Phoebe:Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
 Phoebe:No Chandler they can swallow one of those little parts! And also look at his smooth area that’s just gonna mess them up.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Oh look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
 Phoebe:Oh I can still do that.
 Phoebe:How did that happen?!!
 Phoebe:Yeah but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
 Phoebe:What?! No you can’t you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!
 Phoebe:But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!
 Phoebe:But no because a doctor won’t be able to help him it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
 Phoebe:I’m pretty sure it’s gun.
 Phoebe:A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! (They don’t stop.) No! What would what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)
 Phoebe:Me taking care of you is no problem huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay I’m gonna take that spit bubble as Yeah I do! Okay after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie I’ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at the garbage without looking misses and knocks over a vase and flowers which fall to the floor and break.) Okay I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it we’re at Monica’s. (She crawls over disposes of the diaper picks up the flowers and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well that’s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Okay good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well you can’t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh you’re a lot mischievous! Well it’ll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! (They both have disappeared as well.)
 Phoebe:(exhausted) How do you feel?
 Phoebe:Okay so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em bathed ‘em and put ‘em to bed.
 Phoebe:I know the babies are asleep.
 Phoebe:I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
 Phoebe:So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
 Phoebe:Well how much do you think he needs?
 Phoebe:Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
 Phoebe:And also my birthday.
 Phoebe:What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!
 Phoebe:Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
 Phoebe:My God I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.
 Phoebe:Well what you’re wearing is fine for that.
 Phoebe:I have plans.
 Phoebe:That’s right.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now it’s too late for me but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the door.)
 Phoebe:You guys we said we were gonna have fun! Come on hey remember the time… (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don’t remember?
 Phoebe:Well this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.
 Phoebe:Come on there’s gotta be something.
 Phoebe:Good! Great! You can go first.
 Phoebe:Good that’s a good one. Okay Monica anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
 Phoebe:Okay good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?
 Phoebe:Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
 Phoebe:Yeah I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey uh remember the roller blades?
 Phoebe:Hey! I call her!
 Phoebe:Yeah we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
 Phoebe:Well one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!
 Phoebe:I know I took it hard too.
 Phoebe:Hey how are you guys doing?
 Phoebe:Okay you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay you guys… STOP!! (They stop.) I know that I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.
 Phoebe:Well deep-deep-deep down!
 Phoebe:Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)
 Phoebe:Hey you guys I don’t mean to make things worse but umm I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
 Phoebe:You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
 Phoebe:What else?
 Phoebe:That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
 Phoebe:Okay Rachel I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!
 Phoebe:Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?
 Phoebe:Ready?
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:its...
 Phoebe:and…
 Phoebe:please...
 Phoebe:leave…
 Phoebe:Yeah I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get it’s and oh Im sorry I have A. Forget it.

 Phoebe:I have to tie my shoe so you go ahead Ill catch up.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far apart) Come on! Thats not running! Lets go! (Rachel pauses then follows embarrassed.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Why? Why would you do that?
 Phoebe:(jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah uh-huh its me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
 Phoebe:Please Rachel I am not an idiot. (Runs off)

 Phoebe:Uh-Huh Which is...?
 Phoebe:So?
 Phoebe:Why do you care?
 Phoebe:But people that you dont know and will never see again.
 Phoebe:Well I didnt get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no okay. No no I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah okay. Youre uptight.
 Phoebe:Thats okay Rachel. Im not judging you; thats just who you are. Me. Im more free yknow? I run like I did when I was a kid cause thats the only way its fun. Yknow I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Yknow like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbors dog.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:See? And you dont care if people are staring its just for a second cause then youre gone!
 Phoebe:(Walking over and Sitting down.) Hey.
 Phoebe:Rachel?
 Phoebe:I’m uhh making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.
 Phoebe:Oh my God. What happened?
 Phoebe:Well that’s great! Congratulations!! (She hugs Rachel.)
 Phoebe:(Hugging her again.) You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
 Phoebe:Thank you.
 Phoebe:Now you will not believe this. But I was in the copy room making copies and Ralph Lauren came in.
 Phoebe:Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
 Phoebe:Totally.
 Phoebe:Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know we’re making out. You know.
 Phoebe:No!
 Phoebe:What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married? (Rachel looks at her.) No yeah I should.
 Phoebe:Hey. Here. (Hands Chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of Ralph.) Ohh who’s the silver fox?
 Phoebe:That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
 Phoebe:Yeah no Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
 Phoebe:Ohhh.
 Phoebe:Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
 Phoebe:But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.
 Phoebe:Well hey what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh did she ever think of that?
 Phoebe:Just for a second.
 Phoebe:Well the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
 Phoebe:Ohh sleep with Kenny.
 Phoebe:Ohh yes it would.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Wow that sounds great! And what are you making Monica in case Rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!
 Phoebe:And who else is going to be there?
 Phoebe:Yeah and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
 Phoebe:Rach Rach I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
 Phoebe:Yeah I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know I mean he used to be just y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller dream hunk.
 Phoebe:Rachel?
 Phoebe:Okay look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.
 Phoebe:Monica leave him alone!
 Phoebe:So now Rach this is a traditional English trifle isn’t it?
 Phoebe:Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
 Phoebe:I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. (Faking dissapointment.) Ohhh no.
 Phoebe:Rachel come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) Okay I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream about Jack.
 Phoebe:I dunno let’s see! So okay I dreamt that we were gonna get married and he left becuz he had to go fight a fire. And um so okay I went to a night club and I saw him making out with a girl.
 Phoebe:Yeah but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse who by the way was totally coming on to me and please that is not gonna happen.
 Phoebe:Five minutes ago a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well not nothing I am still a woman.
 Phoebe:(joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!
 Phoebe:That is nice and we’re done. TADA!
 Phoebe:Yeah Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.
 Phoebe:No-no we do it every year!
 Phoebe:No yeah we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.
 Phoebe:But we have to!
 Phoebe:Well then you should look with us.
 Phoebe:Oh that’s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!
 Phoebe:Ooh ooh we have a live one!
 Phoebe:Ooh who’s it for?
 Phoebe:Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
 Phoebe:Yeah and you have nothing to worry about cos theyre all crap!
 Phoebe:Ohhh. Thanks Chandler theyre great!
 Phoebe:Oh okay Im sorry thank you for my azzz.
 Phoebe:Hey! Look who I found!
 Phoebe:Y’know birds have a very good sense of direction and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
 Phoebe:Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay c’mon guys show us where the presents are!
 Phoebe:Hmm how about my azzz?
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:No don’t look directly at them!
 Phoebe:Alright no we could look at them!
 Phoebe:Oh this one’s for Chandler. Here.
 Phoebe:And the big one’s for me!
 Phoebe:Hee hee!
 Phoebe:Will you get us better gifts?
 Phoebe:Oh yes I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
 Phoebe:She’s made it pretty clear it is not going to happen.
 Phoebe:Yeah well we’ll see.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:(sees the table) Ooh what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
 Phoebe:Umm a flea market?
 Phoebe:Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She’s opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
 Phoebe:Y’know? Ooh you can almost smell the opium.
 Phoebe:How much was it?
 Phoebe:500 bucks at a flea market?!
 Phoebe:Oh no.
 Phoebe:A dollar?
 Phoebe:Ohh okay they gave you the old time pricing.
 Phoebe:Well what period is it from?
 Phoebe:Yes yes I do. God oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or…
 Phoebe:(gasps) White Plains. Oh it sounds like such a magical place.
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Okay. Hey—Ooh cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.)
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
 Phoebe:Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off but drags the sheet with her which spills the wine.) Noo!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Ross where did you get this?!
 Phoebe:Wow! Oh my God well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
 Phoebe:Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
 Phoebe:Oh Ross calm down I’ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at Rachel)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:(sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
 Phoebe:(gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
 Phoebe:Ah!
 Phoebe:Yeah no I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should you should ask Rachel to help.
 Phoebe:Oh come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
 Phoebe:No! I do want to!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
 Phoebe:Uck look at this! Pottery Barn yuck!
 Phoebe:No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!
 Phoebe:That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
 Phoebe:Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
 Phoebe:No-no-no but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!
 Phoebe:I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?
 Phoebe:But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?
 Phoebe:Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
 Phoebe:But at least the apothecary table is real.
 Phoebe:I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey.
 Phoebe:Wh-wh-what are you doing?
 Phoebe:Oh I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). Yikes!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah. Aw remember the days when you used to go out to the barn lift up your shirt and bend over?
 Phoebe:Rachel.
 Phoebe:I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither.
 Phoebe:I guess it was kinda funny.
 Phoebe:Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!
 Phoebe:No okay you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.
 Phoebe:Ya you know Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know you can just walk all over her.
 Phoebe:Oh okay (laughing) you’re not a pushover.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:That true I am flaky.
 Phoebe:Yeah totally.
 Phoebe:That’s great. Good for you guys.
 Phoebe:Who said you were?
 Phoebe:Oh I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.
 Phoebe:Really? I’ve heard better.
 Phoebe:(to Monica) Y’know suddenly I find you very attractive.
 Phoebe:Wow! That is a bad audition.
 Phoebe:(returning from the bathroom) Rach you’re in my seat.
 Phoebe:Hey I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
 Phoebe:Yeah well I kinda thought.
 Phoebe:Yeah Joey that is so gross!
 Phoebe:(giggles) I’m pretty.
 Phoebe:Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh y’know what? No. (Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming in it.) I know it’s in here somewhere.
 Phoebe:(To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter?
 Phoebe:Never mind I got it.
 Phoebe:Of course yeah!
 Phoebe:Ooh I like cards.
 Phoebe:Seriously I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.
 Phoebe:I would love that job!
 Phoebe:Sorry Jill.
 Phoebe:Oh well all right I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you I got uh this y’know I want a job sweater. (Holds up the same sweater.)
 Phoebe:And and then I got uh these are apartment pants.
 Phoebe:Yeah you never heard of them?
 Phoebe:What about what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants how dumb was I?
 Phoebe:(gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it!
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Umm I think there’s something you should maybe know.
 Phoebe:No. No. It’s just I was umm I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
 Phoebe:Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Okay then.
 Phoebe:But great news about the apartment pants huh?
 Phoebe:(crying) Yeah me too.
 Phoebe:Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
 Phoebe:All right what’s going on there? (Points to a picture.)
 Phoebe:Oh Chandler!
 Phoebe:So that story doesn’t make you cry?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi! (Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)
 Phoebe:You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. (The fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen take good care of that guy okay? (Points) He’s a fan. (To the fan as she’s leaving) Bye! (Exits)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey! What’s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
 Phoebe:It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
 Phoebe:(seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
 Phoebe:You’re making one right now!
 Phoebe:And-and you’re using my name!
 Phoebe:Look I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into the apartment) And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you (points to someone) with that! (Storms away.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:So I just came from the company Ursula works for.
 Phoebe:No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.
 Phoebe:Um-mmm and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
 Phoebe:Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
 Phoebe:Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where he’s seen her before.) (To him) You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To Joey) See?
 Phoebe:Wow!
 Phoebe:No! Barry and Mindy.
 Phoebe:Which time?
 Phoebe:What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
 Phoebe:Yeah I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
 Phoebe:Because at that time you see I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks I’d have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Ohh that’s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0 it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No it’s okay. It’s okay you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding you are of course fired.
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Who’s this? (Listens) Oh okay you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? (Listens) What kind of name is Brendy? I… Whatever… Stop talking! All right from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
 Phoebe:(yelling from Monica’s room) No-no!! No!!
 Phoebe:No! There-there was a little a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
 Phoebe:What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great now my chest hearts.
 Phoebe:(louder) My chest hurts! Oh and now I-I can’t breathe.
 Phoebe:Oh if I were would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
 Phoebe:Then yes that is what I’m having. (Takes another puff of the cigarette.)
 Phoebe:Most people don’t like their jobs I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.
 Phoebe:(To Ross) So what’s going on with you?
 Phoebe:Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
 Phoebe:How long has it been since you had sex?
 Phoebe:Oh that’s not so bad.
 Phoebe:That is.
 Phoebe:Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
 Phoebe:I don’t know. You could tie her up she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…
 Phoebe:Y’know dirty talk m�nage � trois toys…
 Phoebe:Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
 Phoebe:Yeah! Or too you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
 Phoebe:No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
 Phoebe:Okay! Okay! (Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I’m so glad you’re here.
 Phoebe:Oh give it to me.
 Phoebe:Give it!
 Phoebe:Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
 Phoebe:Thank God.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Well I’ve got to get out of this bed I’m going crazy here. Crazy!
 Phoebe:What the hell is this herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
 Phoebe:What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
 Phoebe:Okay what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! (Points at Ross.)
 Phoebe:I know! But if I didn’t work there what else would I do?
 Phoebe:Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
 Phoebe:Hmm pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh what do I do?! What will I do?!
 Phoebe:I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.
 Phoebe:No. I’ve learned my lesson.
 Phoebe:Let’s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old man who’s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.) Thanks Lou good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)
 Phoebe:Surprise! Look who’s back!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Uh I don’t think so!
 Phoebe:Jack!! Hey!
 Phoebe:All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research huh?
 Phoebe:Nu-uh!
 Phoebe:Oh okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway I’ll be in my office.
 Phoebe:That’s all right I’ll work here. This is goo next to this plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
 Phoebe:You’re in my office! Look I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…
 Phoebe:Oh so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh you have got to be kidding!
 Phoebe:I’m having another heart attack!
 Phoebe:I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
 Phoebe:(to Arthur he’s the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!
 Phoebe:Well they fired me and I’m having heart attack.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:(singing)
 Phoebe:Or y’know I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it) goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
 Phoebe:Now we can kick anybody’s ass!
 Phoebe:Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!
 Phoebe:(deadpan) Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.
 Phoebe:You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Ooh Joey that’s actually a really good idea!
 Phoebe:You guys!
 Phoebe:Oh I love paper mache! What did you make?
 Phoebe:What is that?
 Phoebe:Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She takes out a sock that’s been made into a bunny with eyes nose mouth whiskers and two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!
 Phoebe:Now it’s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel’s face and they both laugh.)
 Phoebe:Ross!!!
 Phoebe:Ohh you’re a freak!!
 Phoebe:Pat Sajak?
 Phoebe:Alex Trebek?
 Phoebe:Chuck Woolery?
 Phoebe:Say we are unagi!
 Phoebe:(stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!
 Phoebe:Why is Ross doing that?
 Phoebe:We should help him!
 Phoebe:What’s a Movement class?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! How bad was it?
 Phoebe:Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Oh it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
 Phoebe:No not usually. But yeah I could use one right now.
 Phoebe:Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
 Phoebe:Well since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should get to stay here.
 Phoebe:Well no it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
 Phoebe:What’s that smell?
 Phoebe:So did you sleep well last night?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?
 Phoebe:Gum!
 Phoebe:Yeah I know it was my candle. My candle!
 Phoebe:I don’t use a curling iron.
 Phoebe:Thanks Monica!
 Phoebe:What the smell from Joey’s? No I can hardly smell it over here.
 Phoebe:I can smell it a little bake the pie.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens) Really?!
 Phoebe:Well not much has changed in the last five minutes.
 Phoebe:Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Reaches for one.)
 Phoebe:(gritting her teeth) Okay I’ll be out in a second.
 Phoebe:That doesn’t lock does it?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey! Hi!
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Listen umm yeah okay I need to talk to you!
 Phoebe:Now I know that they said that the umm the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see I didn’t I didn’t tell you but umm but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.
 Phoebe:Okay. Oh umm Chandler Monica is looking for you.
 Phoebe:Yeah she said something about crumbies.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Okay you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
 Phoebe:No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
 Phoebe:All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet paper towels.)
 Phoebe:God what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)
 Phoebe:Well what kind of guy are you looking for?
 Phoebe:Y’know this is probably none of my business but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
 Phoebe:Oh sly.
 Phoebe:(interrupting) Okay I got a good one. Okay umm what is she? Like 12?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Okay I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
 Phoebe:Oh that’s good I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
 Phoebe:‘Cause that’s just your taste.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah?
 Phoebe:My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And he has one of these (She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)
 Phoebe:A chin dimple!
 Phoebe:Have you seen your guy’s body?
 Phoebe:Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm when he was on the table I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah like there are police for that!
 Phoebe:I know. (Laughs.)
 Phoebe:Oh Chandler funny?
 Phoebe:My guy is well read.
 Phoebe:My guy has great teeth!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What did you do on yours?
 Phoebe:Rachel what the hell is this?!
 Phoebe:You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
 Phoebe:Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
 Phoebe:So Sebastian do you do any volunteer work?
 Phoebe:No reason it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
 Phoebe:Well so do a lot of people.
 Phoebe:Yeah y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? Hey Sebastian would you like to dance? (Imitates him.) Uhh okay—I gotta go!
 Phoebe:Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.
 Phoebe:Okay sure!
 Phoebe:Ooh technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Ross you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.
 Phoebe:Nothing you just have to be cool with it.
 Phoebe:This is Patrick. (Points to him.)
 Phoebe:(looks) Oh my God you’re right! I am too late; they’re sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.) Rachel?
 Phoebe:This is Patrick.
 Phoebe:Yeah this is the guy I was telling you about.
 Phoebe:Yeah. And believe me this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Oh! Okay! Yeah that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)
 Phoebe:Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay let’s talk it out.
 Phoebe:Then why did she ask us to…
 Phoebe:Rachel we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.
 Phoebe:Oh my God look! That’s Elizabeth!
 Phoebe:You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
 Phoebe:Don’t worry about me I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!
 Phoebe:(she stops reading from the script) Oh my God.
 Phoebe:I am extremely talented!
 Phoebe:(interrupting) No I mean I was really acting my ass off.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah you’re solid. Yeah you’re just no me.
 Phoebe:(tremendously overacting) Fine! I’ll do it without you! (Joey gives her thumbs up) I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! (Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You’ll see!! You’ll all see!!
 Phoebe:I am.
 Phoebe:(overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
 Phoebe: Well he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... (The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his hands up Phoebes legs and grabbing her butt.)
 Phoebe: And all of the sudden his hands werent the problem anymore. (The flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)
 Phoebe: Oh Boy Scouts couldve camped under it!
 Phoebe: Its not that bad.
 Phoebe: Chandler Chandler.
 Phoebe:Oh!  All right.  Now lets not do this!
 Phoebe:Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
 Phoebe:OK now Im gonna kick some ass.
 Phoebe:I know!  I know!  I know!
 Phoebe:Alright now I will let go if you both stop.
 Phoebe:There we go.You know what if we were in prison you guys would be like my bitches.
 Phoebe:(overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!
 Phoebe:I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like Ooh where’d Ross go?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:(To Ross) He’s holding us back.
 Phoebe:No! Joey you’re going to be great!
 Phoebe:(in a sexy voice to Chandler) I’ll be waiting.
 Phoebe:No I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start writing another book!
 Phoebe:Well if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
 Phoebe:Oh Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
 Phoebe:I want to see what he wants first.
 Phoebe:You’re Elizabeth’s father huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
 Phoebe:(writing frantically) You guys I’m sorry could you please talk a little slower?
 Phoebe:Yeah it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps the pitfalls what not to do keep going. This stuff is great!
 Phoebe:And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. (Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well why don’t you just get him fired?
 Phoebe:(writing in her book) You wish.
 Phoebe:I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.
 Phoebe:Marcia and Chester.
 Phoebe:I see what you’re doing!
 Phoebe:Ooh I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
 Phoebe:(Turning around in the chair) Hi!
 Phoebe:I know what time you said.
 Phoebe:Well actually I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
 Phoebe:Quite an interesting turn of events suddenly it’s my book to the rescue huh? (Reading her book) Ooh very interesting. Yeah well this certainly clears things up.
 Phoebe:I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
 Phoebe:Thanks! So are you.
 Phoebe:(reading from her book) Mon… (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six Chester thinks it’s at seven.
 Phoebe:That’s right.
 Phoebe:(writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
 Phoebe:(dejected) Hi you guys.
 Phoebe:Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
 Phoebe:No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
 Phoebe:Okay that’s so generous!
 Phoebe:Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
 Phoebe:Oh this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
 Phoebe:(gasps) Ohh okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we’d be great together!
 Phoebe:So umm now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?
 Phoebe:Hey and then lunch.
 Phoebe:Oh wow. What do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?
 Phoebe:No reason! That would just be a really big surprise right?
 Phoebe:Yeah but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else y’know? Someone someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)
 Phoebe:Me too!
 Phoebe:I don’t know I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?
 Phoebe:Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.
 Phoebe:Don’t even get me started on yours!
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:No! Why?
 Phoebe:Well for the regular guy it’s bad but Chandler Oh dear God!
 Phoebe:What are you gonna do?
 Phoebe:Rachel said that!
 Phoebe:Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh Joey! Why did you sign it Son of a bitch? (Son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)
 Phoebe:Okay maybe ask this guy.
 Phoebe:Well what did he do?
 Phoebe:Joey!
 Phoebe:Well we should go.
 Phoebe:(entering from her room) Hey did she buy it?
 Phoebe:So did Heldi show you the place?
 Phoebe:I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
 Phoebe:Now have you told anyone else?
 Phoebe:You told me.
 Phoebe:Yeah well once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.
 Phoebe:Hey! So Chandler wanna go to the coffeehouse?
 Phoebe:Yeah coffeehouse.
 Phoebe:So how are things going with Paul?
 Phoebe:That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.
 Phoebe:No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Watch this.
 Phoebe:Hi Paul!
 Phoebe:So how are things going with you?
 Phoebe:Yeah! That was so weird huh?
 Phoebe:I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!
 Phoebe:Please I think you know why.
 Phoebe:Come on Ross you’re a paleontologist dig a little deeper.
 Phoebe:Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?
 Phoebe:Well then I think that’s it.
 Phoebe:Oh if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
 Phoebe:Okay so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
 Phoebe:Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
 Phoebe:(coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute no this is this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
 Phoebe:Or not whatever.
 Phoebe:Chandler I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?
 Phoebe:We will give you $10.
 Phoebe:We stand firm at $10.
 Phoebe:Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
 Phoebe:I’ll give you $1 for them.
 Phoebe:Okay umm I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think too much?
 Phoebe:Okay. Then take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh let me see the ring my friend picked out.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!! (She runs after him but sets of the security system which locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her caging her in.) No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)
 Phoebe:Chandler I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)
 Phoebe:Oh my God Chandler the one you picked is gone. It’s over!
 Phoebe:Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!
 Phoebe:The little jail between the doors!
 Phoebe:I know I’m sorry! But y’know this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
 Phoebe:Maybe it was the guy.
 Phoebe:(entering from her room) Hey.
 Phoebe:It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!
 Phoebe:Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
 Phoebe:Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.
 Phoebe:There he is! (Points.)
 Phoebe:Wow! You’re good! After this we should solve crimes.
 Phoebe:Oh okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
 Phoebe:It is your office.
 Phoebe:John?
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) Here he is.
 Phoebe:Wow! I would trade.
 Phoebe:Yeah do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?
 Phoebe:Yes and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…
 Phoebe:(entering) Hi.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh I know I helped pick out the ring.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:If she says no can I have the ring?
 Phoebe:If!
 Phoebe:(with her mouthful) Hi Monica.
 Phoebe:It’s gone.
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) We’re practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and winks at him.)
 Phoebe:Open bar?
 Phoebe:I can do that for the kids.
 Phoebe:Y’know you are 12 years older than her.
 Phoebe:Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)
 Phoebe:Here.
 Phoebe:So now what’s going on here?
 Phoebe:No I know what a silent is I meant what’s going on with your hair?
 Phoebe:No! It’s nice!
 Phoebe:Oh hi. (They shake hands.)
 Phoebe:Hey you guys! Look!
 Phoebe:I got me some drinks!
 Phoebe:Open bar!
 Phoebe:You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you?
 Phoebe:Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.]
 Phoebe:Well just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way through her tray of booze.)
 Phoebe:I’m just helping the kids!
 Phoebe:Because the more I drink the less there is for the kids to drink.
 Phoebe:Oh okay.
 Phoebe:It’s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she’s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.) Excuse me is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
 Phoebe:Oh en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it but he only shakes it.)
 Phoebe:Ohh let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)
 Phoebe:I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
 Phoebe:Eww! Oh it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.
 Phoebe:What happened?
 Phoebe:Well a palm reader a manicurist a hand doctor…
 Phoebe:Good one! Yeah.
 Phoebe:Look she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure so just throw her off the track.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!
 Phoebe:No you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
 Phoebe:I know they’re gonna be so happy together.
 Phoebe:Not that often!
 Phoebe:Me too! So happy for them!
 Phoebe:Oh no! No God definitely not jealous!
 Phoebe:Totally. I’m like 90/10.
 Phoebe:Definitely!
 Phoebe:What do you mean?
 Phoebe:You mean a backup?
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah I got that.
 Phoebe:Hm-mmm.
 Phoebe:Joey.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Yeah I locked him years ago!
 Phoebe:Yep we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
 Phoebe:Ohh yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
 Phoebe:Well hey it’s just a backup.
 Phoebe:Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look I’ve already lost Chandler!
 Phoebe:I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
 Phoebe:Okay this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!
 Phoebe:All right well let’s see Ross is a good father but Joey has a boat—This is hard!
 Phoebe:No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions okay? Just remember my promise when we get married three times a week.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) I’m talking about massages.
 Phoebe:Good!
 Phoebe:Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.
 Phoebe:(reading) Ross!
 Phoebe:Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)
 Phoebe:Oh no wait no this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!
 Phoebe:Oh no let her stay out there. It’s sweet.
 Phoebe:So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because y’know I’m kinda musical.
 Phoebe:Well speaking of chiming in remember the time you burned down my apartment?
 Phoebe:Oh 19! We thought you said 90!
 Phoebe:Oh honey no you ate it all.
 Phoebe:Check it out. Okay I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)
 Phoebe:If you would’ve let me finish it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.
 Phoebe:I’m sorry but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)
 Phoebe:Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.
 Phoebe:Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
 Phoebe:You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
 Phoebe:What a great night Chandler can’t do it these guys kissed… (Points to Ross and Rachel.)
 Phoebe:Well yeah that and Chandler’s problem.
 Phoebe:Okay so The Plaza! Okay we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.
 Phoebe:Why?!
 Phoebe:(she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay I think I’ll play it at the wedding.
 Phoebe:Well I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.
 Phoebe:Would she?
 Phoebe:Okay you said I could sing at your wedding so I’m just gonna need a small deposit.
 Phoebe:Y’know just some good faith money to hold the date.
 Phoebe:Oh I see. (Exits angrily.)
 Phoebe:Y’know I don’t really their permission.
 Phoebe:Yeah! And if you wanna look 19 then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.
 Phoebe:They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
 Phoebe:Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
 Phoebe:(singing angrily)
 Phoebe:(singing)
 Phoebe:Oh thank you.
 Phoebe:Now… (Starts singing again) Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer—(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the door behind him)—Oh—oh! All right I’ll pound on him in the morning.
 Phoebe:It starts?
 Phoebe:That is so smart! (To Chandler under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.
 Phoebe:Hey! Ross!
 Phoebe:I need to talk to you it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.
 Phoebe:Well umm not much. But I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy y’know? So could I just move in with you for a couple days?
 Phoebe:Nothing—Why?!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
 Phoebe:(to the students) Oh I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
 Phoebe:Oh Ross hi.
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I’m with a client right now.
 Phoebe:Okay let’s talk outside.
 Phoebe:What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!
 Phoebe:(pause as she considers it) Okay well Ross what is this really about?
 Phoebe:Okay I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!
 Phoebe:(gasps) My God! What did you order?!
 Phoebe:Look why don’t you just pay for it yourself?
 Phoebe:(reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello Mr. Chandler.
 Phoebe:Wow money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
 Phoebe:(entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
 Phoebe:My massage client Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
 Phoebe:He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
 Phoebe:Well he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
 Phoebe:Oh it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
 Phoebe:So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
 Phoebe:Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
 Phoebe:You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
 Phoebe:You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
 Phoebe:Break my heart—Oh all right.
 Phoebe:If you don’t sail your boat what do you do on it?
 Phoebe:Your own boat?
 Phoebe:I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
 Phoebe:(pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
 Phoebe:Okay here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)
 Phoebe:See no-no I made a batch and I froze it and this is the only one left.
 Phoebe:Why not?
 Phoebe:Really?!
 Phoebe:You do?
 Phoebe:That and arrogance.
 Phoebe:I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
 Phoebe:Come on it’s not that big a deal!
 Phoebe:Oh what was that for? Like a bake sale?
 Phoebe:Yeah but not as good as batch 17.
 Phoebe:Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.
 Phoebe:Y’know I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah—No she was really nice to me but she’s in hell for sure.
 Phoebe:Oh no-no no I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th 2032.
 Phoebe:That’s what you think.
 Phoebe:Well y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother Nesele Tolouse.
 Phoebe:Nesele Toulouse.
 Phoebe:Oh you Americans always butcher the French language.
 Phoebe:(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.
 Phoebe:I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) you’re burning in hell!!
 Phoebe:I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh yeah that’s right.
 Phoebe:What? You mean behind my back?
 Phoebe:(gasps) Oh God!
 Phoebe:Oh hey!
 Phoebe:(To Monica) Anyway I should go. Okay bye.
 Phoebe:Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute you hire them because they’re qualified.
 Phoebe:Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him because that—it’s not professional. Umm this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)
 Phoebe:Hey—Ooh how’s Hilda? Is she working out?
 Phoebe:Sorry.
 Phoebe:What happened?
 Phoebe:You! An actor?! That’s madness!
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:You must be Hilda.
 Phoebe:Oh you like that? You should hear my phone number.
 Phoebe:So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
 Phoebe:But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
 Phoebe:Oh Willie’s still alive!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.
 Phoebe:Hey why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.
 Phoebe:Yeah that’s great! Next to that Chandler won’t look so stupid.
 Phoebe:(returning) Hey you guys Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
 Phoebe:He is! But he’s getting divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.
 Phoebe:You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!
 Phoebe:So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?
 Phoebe:I’m having a really good time!
 Phoebe:Ohh. No that’s okay he’s a friend.
 Phoebe:Yeah I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals so I’d just be lost.
 Phoebe:Okay don’t freak out. I’ll go.
 Phoebe:Okay I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?
 Phoebe:Yeah umm that’s Whitney (Points) Kyle’s ex-wife out there now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?
 Phoebe:Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)
 Phoebe:Hi Ginger.
 Phoebe:I don’t have it!
 Phoebe:Ugh okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)
 Phoebe:All right well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle’s ex.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:(To Ross) Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
 Phoebe:Watching ballroom dancing?
 Phoebe:Well look-look okay Ross Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
 Phoebe:Like she’s really mean and she’s over critical and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
 Phoebe:And! She uses sex as a weapon!
 Phoebe:You’re still gonna go out with her?!
 Phoebe:Well didn’t you just hear what I said?!
 Phoebe:(interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!
 Phoebe:You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:So how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
 Phoebe:Yeah well maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
 Phoebe:You think he’s emotionally unavailable?
 Phoebe:Well maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!
 Phoebe:Yeah well she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.
 Phoebe:(gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!
 Phoebe:Oh I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed how’s Whitney?
 Phoebe:Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.
 Phoebe:Both of you together?
 Phoebe:What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
 Phoebe:Oh right because you’re so capable of change.
 Phoebe:Yeah and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.
 Phoebe:Oh. Y’know he hums while he does other stuff to.
 Phoebe:And y’know even if they break up again you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!
 Phoebe:Potato Potaato. (She’s pronounces potato with the both the short and long As.)
 Phoebe:Ooh let’s see it!
 Phoebe:You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)
 Phoebe:I hope it’s you.
 Phoebe:Yes!!! Oh!!
 Phoebe:Still.
 Phoebe:Yeah I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?
 Phoebe:Wh-why is that the best part?
 Phoebe:Aww and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
 Phoebe:Hey Rachel?
 Phoebe:Umm when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm.
 Phoebe:Oh! Well if that’s what you want…
 Phoebe:But why does it even matter?!
 Phoebe:Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!
 Phoebe:(gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look Rachel I know you really want to do this but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!
 Phoebe:And no oh please oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.
 Phoebe:Oh thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.
 Phoebe:Oh I know.
 Phoebe:See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!
 Phoebe:Na-uh I am!
 Phoebe:Because I cared enough to lie!
 Phoebe:What are you talking about?
 Phoebe:Okay so after this audition who decides who gets it?
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Well it’s better than us deciding.
 Phoebe:No! Coins hate me!
 Phoebe:Hey there you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
 Phoebe:Ugh what a kiss ass.
 Phoebe:Yes! Your honor?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
 Phoebe:Okay I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)
 Phoebe:Really?! I won!
 Phoebe:The coins have finally forgiven me!
 Phoebe:(running after her) Rach it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:That’s ridiculous Rachel we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh you mean today.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah!
 Phoebe:Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
 Phoebe:Ohh.
 Phoebe:This stuff is great!
 Phoebe:Y’know Rach I think that I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.
 Phoebe:Because I think it means more to you.
 Phoebe:Its fine. I mean this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)
 Phoebe:(looking at the picture again) Man alive!
 Phoebe:Well we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
 Phoebe:Okay!
 Phoebe:And call me!
 Phoebe:We want you to marry her!
 Phoebe:She is so amazing! You have no idea.
 Phoebe:Joey she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.
 Phoebe:Yeah but you always say that.
 Phoebe:Whatever.
 Phoebe:Secret affair!
 Phoebe:(entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh no.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yay!! Oh so you’re not you’re not mad at us anymore?
 Phoebe:Didn’t you sleep together?
 Phoebe:Then change it back!
 Phoebe:No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?
 Phoebe:Does Joey have any idea?
 Phoebe:Yeah you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.
 Phoebe:Yeah and maybe that you’re a real (She says something in Italian and it doesn’t matter what she said. It’s not important so I don’t need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)
 Phoebe:Oh well I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.
 Phoebe:No just a regular old flying dwarf.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:So how was how was your date?
 Phoebe:Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
 Phoebe:Hey Joey y’know what? You are way to good for her.
 Phoebe:Oh I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery and I have one regular celery.
 Phoebe:Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)
 Phoebe:Hey you guys Im gonna go out and take a walk.
 Phoebe:Oh its not!
 Phoebe:Its just my knitting thats all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebes bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. Im very good.
 Phoebe:(answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
 Phoebe:Im sorry whos this?
 Phoebe:No theres no dog here?
 Phoebe:Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
 Phoebe:(Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) Theyre here already? How are they doing this?
 Phoebe:Theres no dog in here.
 Phoebe:No thats just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh good there you are! Listen um I have a dog in my room.
 Phoebe:Well Im watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down picks up the dog and waves with one of its paws) Hello my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
 Phoebe:Thats odd cause this dogs been living here for the past 3 days
 Phoebe:Are you crazy?
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:You dont like ice cream?
 Phoebe:All right. Were gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. Well be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)
 Phoebe:Oh Id say about a month.
 Phoebe:(doing Clunkers) Please dont leave me Ill be lonely.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay.
 Phoebe:You know if you want we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldnt even know.
 Phoebe:Ive had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. Hes not so smart.
 Phoebe:Yeah but you kinda knew that something was going on didnt you?
 Phoebe:Wheres Chandler?
 Phoebe:Wash your hands!!!
 Phoebe:(interrupts him) No no we dont really have time for this right now. Okay we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
 Phoebe:See this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)
 Phoebe:(opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey is Chandler here?
 Phoebe:Okay but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
 Phoebe:Oh no the dogs not going to be there!
 Phoebe:(interrupts her to Monica) Shh wait and see. Maybe we will maybe we wont.
 Phoebe:We have good news look whose back!
 Phoebe:Its a Thanksgiving miracle!
 Phoebe:Yeah she came all the way back from Ross building. Oh the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went to far didnt I? When should I have stopped?
 Phoebe:His first big kid’s bike this is so exciting!
 Phoebe:I never had a bike of my own.
 Phoebe:Well we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips and-and-and a bell and this big white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
 Phoebe:No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. (They’re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
 Phoebe:Not really I got to drag him around too! (They all nod Oh.)
 Phoebe:Yeah and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:(gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
 Phoebe:I love it!!
 Phoebe:Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
 Phoebe:Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
 Phoebe:Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten.
 Phoebe:(starts to leave but stops) Oh and Chandler’s about to cry.
 Phoebe:Oh hi!
 Phoebe:Ohh uh-huh so much!
 Phoebe:Of course!
 Phoebe:Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack gets on pushes off rolls a few feet and falls over.) See?
 Phoebe:(hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!
 Phoebe:Why? Why do I have to learn?
 Phoebe:What kind of an emergency?
 Phoebe:Okay I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
 Phoebe:You won’t let go?
 Phoebe:Swear?!
 Phoebe:(thinks it over) Okay.
 Phoebe:All right.
 Phoebe:Well…
 Phoebe:Okay. (Does so.)
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
 Phoebe:Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
 Phoebe:I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)
 Phoebe:(seeing him) Oh hello liar.
 Phoebe:I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
 Phoebe:Well I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)
 Phoebe:What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
 Phoebe:What?! Why?!
 Phoebe:All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap okay.
 Phoebe:(sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) Please don’t die!
 Phoebe:I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
 Phoebe:Don’t be so corny Ross it’s not an after-school special. (She rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny silver training wheels firmly attached.)
 Phoebe:(entering carrying a skull) Hey!
 Phoebe:Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
 Phoebe:Huh?
 Phoebe:Oh yeah its my moms.
 Phoebe:No no no. Its not! Its not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah no she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us that even though its Christmas people still die. And you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull pulls out a stick of licorice and takes a bite.)
 Phoebe:And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
 Phoebe:(entering) Oh hey you guys!
 Phoebe:Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon so I guess Ill be moving out.
 Phoebe:Yes you will be very sad. All right well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
 Phoebe:Yeah why not?
 Phoebe:Why do you think shes having so much fun living with Joey?
 Phoebe:Really? So she said she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?
 Phoebe:Youre sure? Youre absolutely sure?
 Phoebe:Probably? Yeah I dont like that word. (Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah uh-huh. Yeah oh Your mom probably wont kill herself y’know? Im sorry but Im not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on Probably! Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
 Phoebe:So you like the drums! Thats thats great! Y’know I was worried that you know they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right okay well apparently not! So yay!
 Phoebe:Thats fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey! (she sits down next to him)
 Phoebe:Yes thank you. You see this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
 Phoebe:Maybe on some level.
 Phoebe:(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey Joey I got you another present. (She puts it on the counter)
 Phoebe:Its a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel look Im sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big gross scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
 Phoebe:(sarcastic) Ah yeah hes so adorable God hes just so much fun Joey is the best Im glad youre having so much fun here. (She turns around about to leave)
 Phoebe:Our apartment is ready.
 Phoebe:Because you would rather live here with Joey.
 Phoebe:Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
 Phoebe:Hm?
 Phoebe:(nods along) Fish!
 Phoebe:Yes but I wanted you to want to live with me but okay if youre having so much fun over here…
 Phoebe:We did have fun didnt we?
 Phoebe:Oh anyway they say if we want we can see it tonight.
 Phoebe:Yay okay!
 Phoebe:Great all right okay and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
 Phoebe:Oh this is terrible. Oh they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!
 Phoebe:Well I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.
 Phoebe:There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) Wow!!
 Phoebe:(returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
 Phoebe:A little bit yeah.
 Phoebe:You heard her too?! You have the gift!
 Phoebe:Are you sure?
 Phoebe:Oh me too.
 Phoebe:No I do not hear that.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Okay I understand why Superman is here but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?
 Phoebe:(entering carrying a skull) Hey!
 Phoebe:Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
 Phoebe:Huh?
 Phoebe:Oh yeah its my moms.
 Phoebe:No no no. Its not! Its not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah no she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us that even though its Christmas people still die. And you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull pulls out a stick of licorice and takes a bite.)

 Phoebe:Okay I understand why Superman is here but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?
 Phoebe:(looking up) There it is! Oh look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature amazing?
 Phoebe:Well all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high that’s pretty amazing too.
 Phoebe:Oh! I won’t say ‘no’ to a movie!
 Phoebe:Shh! Get me out of here.
 Phoebe:(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and finds that it’s the smoke detector that’s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off in frustration she yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed just as she gets there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery but it still beeps.) How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…
 Phoebe:Don’t interrupt me!!
 Phoebe:Okay. So this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (She points at each as she says it.) Okay so to get the beeping to stop all I have to do… (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up and heads to bed stops quickly turns around and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) Well done Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed but is stopped at the entrance to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
 Phoebe:Okay this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the chute.) Noisy bitch!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
 Phoebe:(scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi officer—fireman can-can I help you?
 Phoebe:That’s not mine.
 Phoebe:How do you know?
 Phoebe:Okay do you—Okay do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
 Phoebe:Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
 Phoebe:There’s a reset button?! Ugh thank you! Thank you! (He exits and she goes to shut it off.) There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that! (She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button reset button where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.) Oh! (She presses it hard but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh God!
 Phoebe:What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
 Phoebe:I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey.
 Phoebe:Ugh I hate this year!
 Phoebe:Well okay it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
 Phoebe:Oh that’s right!
 Phoebe:Yeah and yeah and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. (Monica and Ross are shocked.)
 Phoebe:Oh yeah like you never called!
 Phoebe:Okay I can do that! Oh by the way I love my office.
 Phoebe:Oh okay. Umm all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.) Hi this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies can I speak to your supply manager please?
 Phoebe:Umm okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
 Phoebe:Oh okay well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the phone.) Yeah you’re right this is easy.
 Phoebe:Oh well all right…um no offense but you were kind of rude.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do I do have one question. What is toner?
 Phoebe:(on phone) Hi this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies can I speak to your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She’s reading from the script.)
 Phoebe:I’m hearing what you’re saying but at our prices everyone needs toner.
 Phoebe:May I ask why?
 Phoebe:I surely do!
 Phoebe:(doesn’t have any luck) Umm is-is that because you’re out of toner?
 Phoebe:No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Now why do you want to kill yourself?
 Phoebe:Chandler?
 Phoebe:No look I-I’m sure that people know you exist!
 Phoebe:Earl you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her coworkers overhears that and she mimes that she didn’t mean him.)
 Phoebe:Wait what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
 Phoebe:All right so Earl let’s just forget about the people at the office okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family your friends or maybe your girlfriend?
 Phoebe:Oh sorry boyfriend!
 Phoebe:No whatever! Anything!
 Phoebe:Yeah he’s gotta go.
 Phoebe:No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!
 Phoebe:(to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.
 Phoebe:(goes over to his desk) Earl! I’m Phoebe.
 Phoebe:Umm look it you-you can’t kill yourself.
 Phoebe:No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!
 Phoebe:Because it was fate that made me call you today!
 Phoebe:No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
 Phoebe:Yes.
 Phoebe:I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
 Phoebe:No it’s fate!
 Phoebe:Oh. Well umm okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this okay? Your-your name is Earl right? Her name was Pearl P-Earl.
 Phoebe:Sure! (Thinks.) Umm where are you from?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! So was she! Oh I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps. (She holds out her arm.)
 Phoebe:Well y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.
 Phoebe:But if—no look okay. These jerks might not care about you but the universe does! And that says a lot!
 Phoebe:Y’know I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no it’s you.
 Phoebe:Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
 Phoebe:Yeah but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.
 Phoebe:I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head into Central Perk Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)
 Phoebe:Oh well get in line missy. (To Ross) So can I have a ride stud?
 Phoebe:(getting out) Okay who’s next?
 Phoebe:Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.
 Phoebe:Least of all you.
 Phoebe:(running up) Okay. Okay here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right here we go. (She opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel. She inserts the device unlocks the door opens it and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!! (Runs off.)
 Phoebe:Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It’s for the child in you and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
 Phoebe:Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.
 Phoebe:Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
 Phoebe:Yeah. What?!
 Phoebe:Nu-uh!
 Phoebe:You have your birth certificate?
 Phoebe:Our mom.
 Phoebe:Do you have my birth certificate?
 Phoebe:(reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God we are 31.
 Phoebe:I just lost a whole year of my life.
 Phoebe:Your middle name is Pamela?
 Phoebe:Well I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
 Phoebe:That’s my first name.
 Phoebe:Hey what’s going on?
 Phoebe:Yay! I love drunk Monica!
 Phoebe:Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.
 Phoebe:Oh let me guess and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
 Phoebe:If you could do that I’d marry the hippity-hop.
 Phoebe:(clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
 Phoebe:Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!
 Phoebe:(screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Okay quick help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)
 Phoebe:I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!
 Phoebe:Will it? Will it?! I mean how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
 Phoebe:Plus it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
 Phoebe:Like okay I-I-I I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!
 Phoebe:No I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)
 Phoebe:Oh yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)
 Phoebe:You did the right thing.
 Phoebe:(Clears Throat) Rach so that guy there. Straight or gay?
 Phoebe:Yeah? Why?
 Phoebe:Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
 Phoebe:(A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
 Phoebe:Ohh he left his cell phone.
 Phoebe:Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
 Phoebe:Yeah… That does sound great. Im going to get the phone. (They both get up.)
 Phoebe:I dont know. I havent been out on a date in so long.
 Phoebe:That wasn’t a date! That was that was just friends getting together…(quietly) having sex.
 Phoebe:No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
 Phoebe:Nice try.
 Phoebe:I don’t know.
 Phoebe:Ah-ha! Too cocky!
 Phoebe:Or we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
 Phoebe:(handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
 Phoebe:Ohh I lost my mom to suicide.
 Phoebe:Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
 Phoebe:Okay a meat eater. Fine that’s one for you.
 Phoebe:So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Good.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Ooh now you lost me.
 Phoebe:No I didn’t!
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:That is a different phone.
 Phoebe:That is damning evidence.
 Phoebe:(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes I’m the one who found your phone.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Shhh! I’m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah you can pick it up tonight say 830? At-at my apartment. It’s umm it’s umm 5 Morton Street Apartment 14 umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. (Listens) Okay well okay I’ll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)
 Phoebe:Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
 Phoebe:Oh. Okay well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
 Phoebe:What?! That’s the first time today!
 Phoebe:Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
 Phoebe:Because it’s my apartment!
 Phoebe:Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
 Phoebe:Could you-could you umm give us one second?
 Phoebe:Wh-what do we do?
 Phoebe:Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
 Phoebe:Hmm they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!
 Phoebe:Rachel listen—I mean if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
 Phoebe:Yeah! You’re such a great friend!
 Phoebe:Oh that’d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
 Phoebe:(whispering) Nice!
 Phoebe:Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
 Phoebe:(returning with Joey) With what?
 Phoebe:Oo! You should have one of us do it!
 Phoebe:No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
 Phoebe:Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!
 Phoebe:What?! No! It was my idea!
 Phoebe:Oh I have a headache. A horrible headache!
 Phoebe:Oh my God you’ve got to stop chattering!
 Phoebe:What is it?
 Phoebe:Oh no I don’t believe in Western medicine. No if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache so thanks. (Takes the pills.)
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
 Phoebe:Oh I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)
 Phoebe:Say what?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness nervousness drowsiness facial swelling nausea headache—Headache. Vomiting stomach bleeding liver damage! Now okay I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry extra strength death capsules!
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
 Phoebe:Okay then I must be disoriented.
 Phoebe:I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
 Phoebe:Oh interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! (Holds up the warning label.)
 Phoebe:Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
 Phoebe:Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
 Phoebe:Yeah it’s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
 Phoebe:(To Joey) What?!
 Phoebe:I know! Robin is so gay!
 Phoebe:I’m really glad you guys are okay but I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.
 Phoebe:(still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks her watch) That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
 Phoebe:Oh it’s like huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look (reads the side affects) no hair loss not a rash no hives I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath no temporary euphoria—Oh.
 Phoebe:Since when are you into swing music?
 Phoebe:What is your job?
 Phoebe:(wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but look at Monica!
 Phoebe:Ooh is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!
 Phoebe:Got it.
 Phoebe:(coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
 Phoebe:(hearing the signal) I’m coming! I’m coming! (She takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
 Phoebe:Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What are you doing? (Rachel doesn’t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won’t stop so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
 Phoebe:Did you find the dress?
 Phoebe:I—We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
 Phoebe:Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel’s hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (She’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
 Phoebe:I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:(gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
 Phoebe:Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
 Phoebe:Yeah swing music is so out.
 Phoebe:Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) I’m sorry too soon. You go.
 Phoebe:Good for you!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
 Phoebe:Go for it.
 Phoebe:I’m just saying get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
 Phoebe:I did but that was really fun.
 Phoebe:Oh hey!
 Phoebe:Oh great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)
 Phoebe:(laughs) All I could think of was y’know Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?
 Phoebe:I’m a lady Monica I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)
 Phoebe:I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.
 Phoebe:You sound like a guy.
 Phoebe:You’ll have a last kiss.
 Phoebe:Okay bye. (They kiss.)
 Phoebe:Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
 Phoebe:(yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
 Phoebe:No. Why?
 Phoebe:Okay don’t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. (Points to a guy sitting behind Monica.)
 Phoebe:No that is the last thing you want to do!
 Phoebe:Because you’re marrying him!
 Phoebe:All right I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship do not communicate them to your husband.
 Phoebe:That is correct! Yes you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
 Phoebe:Yes!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! You’re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love? (Monica is shocked.)
 Phoebe:Rach?
 Phoebe:Oh. (Picks it up.) It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…
 Phoebe:…in Reservations at 800 by Neil Simon. (To an imaginary Neil Simon) Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. (Blows him a kiss.)
 Phoebe:Please don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
 Phoebe:What are you doing?
 Phoebe:Oh! You got it?!
 Phoebe:The next next?
 Phoebe:What’s the matter?
 Phoebe:Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.
 Phoebe:Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
 Phoebe:Sure.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Well when can we have this shower?
 Phoebe:Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?
 Phoebe:Well if we make it yesterday woo-hoo! We’re done!
 Phoebe:Rachel calm down!
 Phoebe:(grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
 Phoebe:Oh okay. All right then I need to calm down a little.
 Phoebe:Uh here. What time?
 Phoebe:Finger sandwiches and tea.
 Phoebe:And chili!
 Phoebe:Both!
 Phoebe:Neither.
 Phoebe:Lusts of the flesh.
 Phoebe:I don’t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?
 Phoebe:Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.
 Phoebe:Okay. Okay! Well okay who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! (Holds it up.) We have a guest list!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of women.) Hi thanks for coming.
 Phoebe:Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to another pairing.) Oh it’s so nice to see you.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
 Phoebe:Who the hell are all these people?
 Phoebe:Hmm y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!
 Phoebe:You were supposed to tell her!
 Phoebe:Fine I’ll go call her.
 Phoebe:And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Well we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
 Phoebe:We ruined everything.
 Phoebe:Sur-surprise.
 Phoebe:Cassie are you finding everything okay in there?
 Phoebe:Oh! No problem! I… (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)
 Phoebe:(in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin!
 Phoebe:I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey’s like in Checkers.) Chess!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey oh Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
 Phoebe:What is this? What’s going on?
 Phoebe:Joey’s!
 Phoebe:(laughs) Yeah I’m sure that happened.
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
 Phoebe:Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey smiles and nods lewdly.)
 Phoebe:Okay it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:To Ross.
 Phoebe:Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.
 Phoebe:Of course! Yeah I was uh umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Y’know we were really huge too but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
 Phoebe:Really?!
 Phoebe:Oh somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.
 Phoebe:Rachel it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay if-if you say that you kissed Melissa then you kissed Melissa.
 Phoebe:I know.
 Phoebe:I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
 Phoebe:I’ve had better.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Yeah except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)
 Phoebe:Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
 Phoebe:Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like… (They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things you taught him.
 Phoebe:Oh look twins. Hi guys. Oh cute cute.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.
 Phoebe:Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
 Phoebe:Yeah you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?
 Phoebe:(looking out the window) Oh look! Theres Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each others clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
 Phoebe:(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
 Phoebe:CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
 Phoebe:OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
 Phoebe:NO! THEYRE DOING IT!!!
 Phoebe:YOU KNOW?!!!
 Phoebe:(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
 Phoebe:Okay so now they know that you know and they dont know that Rachel knows?
 Phoebe:Or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
 Phoebe:Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
 Phoebe:Ill have to get back to you on that. Okay bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
 Phoebe:No!
 Phoebe:God they thought they can mess with us! Theyre trying to mess with us?! They dont know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey you cant say anything!
 Phoebe:Hes not backing down. He went to get lotion.
 Phoebe:Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow you didn’t rip off any buttons.
 Phoebe:Umm not without you lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So this is my bra.
 Phoebe:You should be. Im very bendy. (Pause) Im gonna kiss you now.
 Phoebe:Ooh.
 Phoebe:Here it comes. Our first kiss.
 Phoebe:And why not?!
 Phoebe:Youre-youre what?!
 Phoebe:I just—I thought you guys were doing it I didnt know you were in love!
 Phoebe:Y’know you’re friend’s getting married it’s gotta change things.
 Phoebe:How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:(To Monica) Oh that’s beautiful.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay I drive it all the time.
 Phoebe:Okay I can fix this! Okay Monica Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)
 Phoebe:Ooh I think I wanna trade circles.
 Phoebe:Okay I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)
 Phoebe:Hey sweetie!
 Phoebe:Yeah! Sure! Ooh I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back. (She goes to get it.)
 Phoebe:What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh. (Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:I know. They were mine.
 Phoebe:No it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
 Phoebe:I’m wearing his briefs right now.
 Phoebe:I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
 Phoebe:And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
 Phoebe:There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.
 Phoebe:I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.
 Phoebe:Okay whatever.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Huh.
 Phoebe:That’s great Joe!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Hmm?
 Phoebe:I think it’s important that you do.
 Phoebe:Feel better?
 Phoebe:Yeah I understand.
 Phoebe:Why?! What’s happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.) Oh! (Realizes.)
 Phoebe:What are they?
 Phoebe:That play?
 Phoebe:The movie?
 Phoebe:Ohh!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah! Back then y’know we called the Great War. It really was!
 Phoebe:Congratulations!
 Phoebe:Go ahead.
 Phoebe:Yes! Very good.
 Phoebe:Ross please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)
 Phoebe:(walking up) What’s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) Tell Monica I’m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
 Phoebe:Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry.
 Phoebe:Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel’s apartment) right now?!
 Phoebe:(pointing at Ross) Okay but if you don’t find him and bring him back I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
 Phoebe:Oh man.
 Phoebe:Okay. Well there’s one down.
 Phoebe:Y’know she might not even notice he’s gone.
 Phoebe:Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can’t do this here! (She drags her into the bathroom.)
 Phoebe:Yeah but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!
 Phoebe:Yeah. (Looks.) Oh that’s gone too. This is Monica’s bathroom right?!
 Phoebe:No-no! I-I…I found one.
 Phoebe:(looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)
 Phoebe:Oh here’s a whole bunch.
 Phoebe:(finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!
 Phoebe:There was a pregnancy test in the garbage and it’s positive. Monica’s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won’t be totally alone.
 Phoebe:I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey can this count as her something new?
 Phoebe:Hey do you think this is why Chandler took off?
 Phoebe:Oh God this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this. (She throws the test back into the trash.)
 Phoebe:Right.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay. Hey wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
 Phoebe:Just for the future this is hardly a commercial for it.
 Phoebe:You told them he was missing?
 Phoebe:Okay. I’m going with you.
 Phoebe:Ross you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
 Phoebe:Okay. Wait do you know how you’re going to stall her?
 Phoebe:All right. Good luck.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)
 Phoebe:He could be in disguise y’know.
 Phoebe:What the hell are you doing?!
 Phoebe:Why not?!
 Phoebe:But look Chandler right now no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
 Phoebe:(entering) Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eye on it y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…
 Phoebe:So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
 Phoebe:Oh my God Monica!
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Wait! Maybe maybe you’re overreacting! You do that y’know.
 Phoebe:Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:What’s going on?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
 Phoebe:Hey! Oh!
 Phoebe:You know?!
 Phoebe:What? You’ll hi-ya?
 Phoebe:Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey Mon why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?
 Phoebe:We found your test in the trash if you’re not pregnant—(She sees Rachel shaking her head)—It’s because I am.
 Phoebe:Yes I…I am with child. (Flash) And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder.
 Phoebe:I can’t say.
 Phoebe:I can’t say because he’s famous.
 Phoebe:Okay okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
 Phoebe:What?! Well he never said that to me!
 Phoebe:How about just the bridemaids?
 Phoebe:It is.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
 Phoebe:Sneaky.
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm.
 Phoebe:Oh I know. I could only think of two names him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.
 Phoebe:(intrigued) Really?!
 Phoebe:So are you ready to talk about it?
 Phoebe:Now?
 Phoebe:Okay we’ll talk about something else then.
 Phoebe:Who’s the father?!
 Phoebe:Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?
 Phoebe:Okay I’m sorry. I’ll stop.
 Phoebe:Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God it’s Joey!
 Phoebe:Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him.
 Phoebe:Well I just got off the phone with my lover James Brolin…
 Phoebe:Yes and apparently he is married to some singer but he said he would leave her for me. And I said James James Brolin are you sure? James Brolin said…
 Phoebe:(shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?
 Phoebe:Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.
 Phoebe:When I got pregnant with the triplets I took that test like three times just to make sure.
 Phoebe:I’m-I’m just saying don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.
 Phoebe:I’ll run out and get you one.
 Phoebe:Oh no she won’t tell us.
 Phoebe:See? This is why you register.
 Phoebe:30 seconds.
 Phoebe:It’s time.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Umm it’s negative.
 Phoebe:It’s negative.
 Phoebe:Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
 Phoebe:No it’s positive.
 Phoebe:It’s-it’s not negative it’s positive.
 Phoebe:Well yeah I lied before.
 Phoebe:Now you know how you really feel about it.
 Phoebe:With who?
 Phoebe:Oh! Joey uh were you in our room last night?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
 Phoebe:A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
 Phoebe:Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know it’s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)
 Phoebe:Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.
 Phoebe:Ooh is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
 Phoebe:What?! I think he’s cute.
 Phoebe:Believe me I’m trying.
 Phoebe:Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check or the raw sexual magnetism.
 Phoebe:Pretty big? It’s huge! God this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.
 Phoebe:Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!
 Phoebe:I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah. That’s me.
 Phoebe:Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God I’m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)
 Phoebe:You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like she’s pregnant.)
 Phoebe:David Lynn.
 Phoebe:Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
 Phoebe:Hey! Ooh did you do it yet?
 Phoebe:Oh well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it Gunther?
 Phoebe:Thank God ‘cause that hair on a baby…
 Phoebe:Why not?
 Phoebe:Bus?
 Phoebe:Well-well but it is huge.
 Phoebe:You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of…See?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey.
 Phoebe:All right. (She sits down like she’s pregnant again.)
 Phoebe:Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)
 Phoebe:Hey lady your day’s over! It’s my turn!
 Phoebe:I can and I will! (Kisses him.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:It’s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths ‘I love you’ to him.)
 Phoebe:We don’t know.
 Phoebe:Who? Who is it?
 Phoebe:Was that story over?
 Phoebe:(gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is… (She walks into Monica and Chandler’s.)
 Phoebe:Look I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
 Phoebe:I may play the fool at times but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
 Phoebe:Really? Are you sure?
 Phoebe:Okay sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)
 Phoebe:Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm I believe that this is your red sweater.
 Phoebe:Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)
 Phoebe:What?!!
 Phoebe:No!!
 Phoebe:I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
 Phoebe:Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
 Phoebe:Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
 Phoebe:Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
 Phoebe:It was his sweater but—Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Me too! (Joins the hug.)
 Phoebe:Yeah bye.
 Phoebe:Oh its so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
 Phoebe:All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
 Phoebe:What?! They took mine to give to you!
 Phoebe:Maybe they don’t trust us.
 Phoebe:You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?
 Phoebe:No you didn’t.
 Phoebe:Well what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
 Phoebe:What stuff?
 Phoebe:Did Rachel find you?
 Phoebe:Oh she was looking for you.
 Phoebe:Well she really wanted to talk to you now.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:(deadpan) And?
 Phoebe:Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Maybe it’s something you ate?
 Phoebe:Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
 Phoebe:Well why don’t you use your key?
 Phoebe:Oh! We could have done that.
 Phoebe:Oh great! And listen could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
 Phoebe:Oh no.
 Phoebe:Didn’t you two already talk?
 Phoebe:(simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!
 Phoebe:That is brand new information!!
 Phoebe:A little bit.
 Phoebe:Oh Ross.
 Phoebe:Oh hey hi he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. (The chair breaks in half.) Okay we’re in. (She hangs up the phone.)
 Phoebe:Hey! So how was the doctor?
 Phoebe:Good.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Come on in!
 Phoebe:So how was the honeymoon?
 Phoebe:That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.
 Phoebe:Oh Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
 Phoebe:You have got to be kidding me!
 Phoebe:Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.
 Phoebe:I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!
 Phoebe:(nasally) Greg and Jenny?
 Phoebe:You got fake numbered.
 Phoebe:Excuse me I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.
 Phoebe:Hmm I wonder why. Pervert!
 Phoebe:That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand put your left hand down your pants and repeat that!
 Phoebe:Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)
 Phoebe:No! Not the sex part just the stuff leading up to it.
 Phoebe:Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who’ thing to rest! Come on now think!!
 Phoebe:You’re gonna get pregnant.
 Phoebe:Oh you came on to Ross!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Dinner was good!
 Phoebe:I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go!
 Phoebe:(To him) Oh well hello there.
 Phoebe:(To Monica) I didn’t see this on the menu.
 Phoebe:Oh so youre Monica’s boss?
 Phoebe:Oh! I sous stand.
 Phoebe:Oh you…you made pesto?
 Phoebe:Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
 Phoebe:I made it myself.
 Phoebe:Well it’s no pesto.
 Phoebe:Ooh Monica!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.
 Phoebe:But why?!
 Phoebe:Well maybe he was just nervous y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
 Phoebe:But Monica he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
 Phoebe:That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
 Phoebe:Love it!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:But…
 Phoebe:Okay. Okay but you can’t fire him today.
 Phoebe:Because I’m dumping him today.
 Phoebe:He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. (Mimicking him) So did-did you get home from work okay? Did-did you get out of the shower okay?
 Phoebe:Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) I’m so worried about you. Uck! Be a man!
 Phoebe:You can’t fire him and dump him the same day he’ll kill himself.
 Phoebe:Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip I’ll kill myself!
 Phoebe:Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
 Phoebe:Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired blond bitch!
 Phoebe:All right that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:It will be…in a minute. Listen Tim you’re a really great guy.
 Phoebe:Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…
 Phoebe:Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.
 Phoebe:Monica!
 Phoebe:(simultaneously) I’m breaking up with you!
 Phoebe:I’m I’m breaking up with you.
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.
 Phoebe:Oh that’s good the chemistry thing for us too.
 Phoebe:And Tim I just wanna say good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves which disgusts Monica.)
 Phoebe:Oh good! (And there’s general excitement.)
 Phoebe:Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
 Phoebe:Ursula! (Ursula turns smiles and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err it’s me! Phoebe!
 Phoebe:Wait a second! So what’s new with you?
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Huh. Okay. Well I’m really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:Yeah. Okay. Umm y’know my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.
 Phoebe:By the way it’s a costume party.
 Phoebe:(looks down) No. But thanks. (Walks away.)
 Phoebe:Ah Catwoman. So we meet again.
 Phoebe:No it’s me. Phoebe!
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) That is so you!
 Phoebe:No wonder your pregnant.
 Phoebe:Okay I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
 Phoebe:Ursula’s fianc�e?
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:My mother killed herself.
 Phoebe:No-no! That’s okay we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.
 Phoebe:Why are you looking at me like that?
 Phoebe:Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So what are you?
 Phoebe:(laughs) No I-I meant your costume.
 Phoebe:I love the second grade!
 Phoebe:Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.
 Phoebe:Umm I’m a masseuse…by day. (Stands with her hands on her hips like a Supergirl pose.)
 Phoebe:No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.
 Phoebe:Thank you.
 Phoebe:(walking over) Hey. Ursula’s fianc�e is really sweet! He’s a teacher he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:No I’m not! You are!
 Phoebe:Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
 Phoebe:Two weeks? That’s it?
 Phoebe:Oh really?
 Phoebe:Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)
 Phoebe:Peace Corps really? (Ursula motions I don’t know.)
 Phoebe:Hi liar!
 Phoebe:Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
 Phoebe:But they’re not!
 Phoebe:Why are you lying to him?
 Phoebe:You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
 Phoebe:Hmm?
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Sure it does. Yeah yeah.
 Phoebe:Umm listen I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
 Phoebe:Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.
 Phoebe:She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs Ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. (Holds up her nametag.) Okay here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher a waitress. All right here’s her driver license this oughta be good she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
 Phoebe:Oh I almost don’t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just remember I’m a minute younger.
 Phoebe:No. You’re not you’re not stupid.
 Phoebe:That’s good you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?
 Phoebe:Yeah you should. (They shake hands.)
 Phoebe:(looking around) Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.
 Phoebe:(checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?
 Phoebe:Oh my God Eric hi! Wait how’d you get this number?
 Phoebe:Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.
 Phoebe:Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!
 Phoebe:Shhh! I’m talking.
 Phoebe:Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
 Phoebe:No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.
 Phoebe:Not great but we can work on it at lunch. Okay I can be at your apartment in two hours.
 Phoebe:I’ve got friends too. Okay bye.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross I can’t make lunch. (Exits.)
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Yeah me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.
 Phoebe:Maybe this is too weird.
 Phoebe:No don’t tear out your eyes!!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So is that better?
 Phoebe:Look Eric turn around. (He does so.) Look I like you but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh he just touched my hand did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(He kisses her)…second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)
 Phoebe:Ooh oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
 Phoebe:No I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.
 Phoebe:Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see. (Exits.)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:What sex?
 Phoebe:We didn’t have sex.
 Phoebe:(simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
 Phoebe:You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!
 Phoebe:You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!
 Phoebe:Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.
 Phoebe:So I guess this is it.
 Phoebe:Yeah so do you.
 Phoebe:Huh?
 Phoebe:Sure. Yeah he’s kinda sexy.
 Phoebe:Okay so we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.
 Phoebe:Oh. Why not?
 Phoebe:Oh Rachel this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’
 Phoebe:Wow! Oh well I will be there!
 Phoebe:Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both sit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
 Phoebe:Your secret bachelorette party…
 Phoebe:She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!
 Phoebe:Oh I-I don’t eat meat.
 Phoebe:Yeah I don’t eat that either.
 Phoebe:He’s right though the ’74 is absolute piss.
 Phoebe:Rachel!
 Phoebe:Why so he can get mad at the baby?
 Phoebe:It’s slang for pregnant.
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding but I’m really busy that day. Yeah I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
 Phoebe:It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
 Phoebe:I’d better go. (She goes and sits down in the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000 the chair that Sit magazine called chair of the year and they both look at her.) Just over here I don’t want to miss the fight.
 Phoebe:That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! We were on a break! No we weren’t! What happened to you two?!
 Phoebe:(entering quietly) Wow you told your dad the truth.
 Phoebe:Wanna go see a movie?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)
 Phoebe:Yeah! And look (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (There’s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby’s born they’re great for shoplifting melons.
 Phoebe:Turkey’s are beautiful intelligent animals!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Happy Thanksgiving!
 Phoebe:Anything I can do to help?
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)
 Phoebe:Yeah it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So how’s the game?
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
 Phoebe:Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all I didn’t realize this game was on.
 Phoebe:Well normally I don’t but y’know…(looks at the TV)…Green Bay is playing.
 Phoebe:Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
 Phoebe:(nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well done.
 Phoebe:Oh okay.
 Phoebe:Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:(simultaneously) Green Bay.
 Phoebe:Well the Lions technically won but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.
 Phoebe:I think you do.
 Phoebe:What?! What else did you do?
 Phoebe:Oh come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
 Phoebe:Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
 Phoebe:So how did this happen? Did she did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
 Phoebe:I wanna join!
 Phoebe:I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn’t go to high school but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imagined it would be.
 Phoebe:Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
 Phoebe:Is there anything we can do for you?
 Phoebe:How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
 Phoebe:Ohh! Okay! Okay cause when-when he said I can’t wait to hear your first words I thought There’s a trick.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
 Phoebe:Sting has a son that goes there too!
 Phoebe:You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
 Phoebe:Sting’s son seven years old and there’s a picture.
 Phoebe:No it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.
 Phoebe:There you go! Oh you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!
 Phoebe:Wow! They’re beautiful!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Well then get your money back and return them!
 Phoebe:Oh no! Why not?
 Phoebe:How come?!
 Phoebe:Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
 Phoebe:Sure you can! Give them some blocks put them in a playpen!
 Phoebe:Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods Yes.) (To the rest) He’s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!
 Phoebe:Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
 Phoebe:(singing) Rosssss can!
 Phoebe:(singing) Rossss can!
 Phoebe:(singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
 Phoebe:Oh there you are Ben!
 Phoebe:Well I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm the boy’s name is Sting’s son.
 Phoebe:Now Ben sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside but they have famous fathers.
 Phoebe:Him you’re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to find Jack and a teacher notices her.)
 Phoebe:Yes! Yes you can I’m looking for Jack’s parents.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh I’m with Ben.
 Phoebe:I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was it was difficult coming out to my parents.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk just me my lover Carol and the Stings. Umm how-how will I get in touch with them?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain but man what a hot piece of ass.
 Phoebe:Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting’s pen…that he gave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase) Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Why else would I be here?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Umm I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then could we reschedule? For say Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?
 Phoebe:Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert and he’s obviously busy during.
 Phoebe:Unless! Unless umm okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert umm all the while thinking about the children of course.
 Phoebe:Oh thank you. Four would be great.
 Phoebe:Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!
 Phoebe:The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)
 Phoebe:Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
 Phoebe:Oo where are the seats?
 Phoebe:Okay now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting his wife or a member of his family?
 Phoebe:Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest he’s not that good in bed.
 Phoebe:Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy right?
 Phoebe:This is completely normal around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
 Phoebe:Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind now I was carrying triplets so in y’know medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Yeah I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Yeah that’s what you need a good…pill.
 Phoebe:(sitting down next to Ross) Y’know she has a face Ross!
 Phoebe:Bye.
 Phoebe:Wait I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?
 Phoebe:Oh hey! So how did your doctor’s appointment go?
 Phoebe:Oh my God.
 Phoebe:Okay remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
 Phoebe:You wish.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah? Come and get it.
 Phoebe:Ugh! Women!
 Phoebe:Give her a key to your apartment.
 Phoebe:No we hate that.
 Phoebe:(entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?
 Phoebe:Where?! (Ross exits.)
 Phoebe:Hi! Okay Monica Rachel this is my friend Roger.
 Phoebe:So umm I’m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me out?
 Phoebe:Umm he’s here to have sex with you.
 Phoebe:You’re welcome.
 Phoebe:It’s okay he’s a virgin.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay let’s leave these two alone.
 Phoebe:Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! (Phoebe exits.)
 Phoebe:Hi. Listen I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn’t right and I and I want to make it up to you so umm I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna I’m gonna want him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause) (Entering) I’m sorry I thought I could do it and I can’t! (She grabs the cutout and exits for good.)
 Phoebe:Hey! I got you a present!!
 Phoebe:I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago and it finally got here!
 Phoebe:It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
 Phoebe:I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
 Phoebe:Do you really like it?
 Phoebe:Oh really? What was your first?
 Phoebe:No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores how sad.
 Phoebe:Oh I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.
 Phoebe:Wait okay if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you then maybe I should just keep it.
 Phoebe:Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey you guys. Listen I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before—(Sees the top ten list)—Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
 Phoebe:Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!
 Phoebe:I know!
 Phoebe:Don’t touch me!!
 Phoebe:I can’t!! I can’t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
 Phoebe:Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)
 Phoebe:Hey are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
 Phoebe:Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
 Phoebe:Me too!
 Phoebe:Uh huh! If it’s a girl Phoebe and if it’s a boy Phoebo!
 Phoebe:Yeah by Sandrine.
 Phoebe:How-how about you each get five vetoes?
 Phoebe:I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
 Phoebe:Is it me or is veto starting to sound really good?
 Phoebe:(from outside the bathroom) You guys?
 Phoebe:Oh hey Monica I brought back your iron.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Oh just as well I broke this one.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Fine.
 Phoebe:Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.
 Phoebe:(Groans) Is it Chandler?
 Phoebe:Well then tell him to stop staring!
 Phoebe:Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.
 Phoebe:I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know. You know I mean on the one hand Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No I can’t. We’re friends. No oh no. I don’t want to risk what we have.
 Phoebe:Sure yeah. I mean it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well I must say I am on fire! First Chandler now Joey!
 Phoebe:Sure.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Umm Joey I know.
 Phoebe:I knooow.
 Phoebe:I know about your feelings.
 Phoebe:Yes and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica but that’s very rare.
 Phoebe:For God sakes it’s Rachel!
 Phoebe:Yeah that’s Rachel. (To herself) Beat me over the head with it.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Joey I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
 Phoebe:Absolutely! Y’know you get this rush of feelings but then it goes away.
 Phoebe:That’s right there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.
 Phoebe:Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.
 Phoebe:Hi Bubbles. Manly. Well I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
 Phoebe:Well you were wrong he doesn’t like me!
 Phoebe:Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?
 Phoebe:Really? Lee Majors is hot!
 Phoebe:We’re in the bathroom!
 Phoebe:(checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.
 Phoebe:Tell us what?
 Phoebe:Well I left my guitar here again.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Monica closes the door gets the guitar and then hands it out.)
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Great! Umm…(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)
 Phoebe:So do you want to hang out or something?
 Phoebe:Oh are you and Chandler…
 Phoebe:Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
 Phoebe:You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
 Phoebe:You told me you hate massages!
 Phoebe:I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?
 Phoebe:Oh it has a name?
 Phoebe:Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s go! (She storms out.)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hello Chandler lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!
 Phoebe:Why won’t you let me massage you?
 Phoebe:Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!
 Phoebe:I’m curious about the human body.
 Phoebe:But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance okay. Please?
 Phoebe:It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.
 Phoebe:Potato potaato.
 Phoebe:(calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?
 Phoebe:(in a soothing voice) Great let’s begin. (She starts the massage.) How’s the pressure?
 Phoebe:Stating the obvious but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.
 Phoebe:That’s right you just enjoy.
 Phoebe:(getting uncomfortable) Okay.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:No-no I got that.
 Phoebe:Okay. Okay but you should know though I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.
 Phoebe:I mean $500.
 Phoebe:600.
 Phoebe:Oh you make sex noises when you get massaged!
 Phoebe:Yeah and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
 Phoebe:Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?! (Pause) I mean hi.
 Phoebe:No you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look I have I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
 Phoebe:Well not clients lovers. But let’s just y’know try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.
 Phoebe:Yes.
 Phoebe:Great! Okay if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So did you hear something you liked?
 Phoebe:That’s it. Just relax.
 Phoebe:Come on more!
 Phoebe:Yeah you like that don’t you?
 Phoebe:You want it there? You take it there baby!
 Phoebe:Yeah say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what she’s doing.) And now I’m going to cover you back up and umm we’re never doing this again.
 Phoebe:Oh! Hey Rach!
 Phoebe:Oh you too.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:(sighs) Honey I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
 Phoebe:Oh Gunther can I get a scone?
 Phoebe:So how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
 Phoebe:Ugh. Come on Mona don’t kiss ass.
 Phoebe:All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh Rachel wanted to see this tape!
 Phoebe:It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
 Phoebe:Yeah. Candy’s the mother Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
 Phoebe:Oh Monica grow up!
 Phoebe:(knocking and entering) Hey. Look I know you’ve been really depressed lately so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real live furry playmate.
 Phoebe:He-hee!
 Phoebe:This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
 Phoebe:How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
 Phoebe:Taffy really? I’ve never had any.
 Phoebe:Well I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what you’re just never going to tell her?
 Phoebe:If I haven’t said it before she’s a lucky lucky lady! So where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the taffy which she’s been chewing this whole time.) Oh God. Is it gum is it food? What’s the deal? (she swallows it finally) Oh it’s nice! May I try a pink one?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey buddy. How’s my favorite dog huh? How’s my favorite dog? (the dog doesn’t move) You’re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?
 Phoebe:Will you excuse us we need to talk for a moment.
 Phoebe:He’s miserable! What happened to him?
 Phoebe:What stuff?
 Phoebe:Oh…Joey you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world and he spends half a day with you and look at him!
 Phoebe:Okay I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.
 Phoebe:(entering) Oh hey you guys!
 Phoebe:Hey listen let me ask you do you believe in soul mates?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh (To Chandler) and you?
 Phoebe:Okay good.
 Phoebe:Well last night I met Monica’s.
 Phoebe:Yeah I had a date with this guy and I swear to God he is her other half.
 Phoebe:Well he’s tall.
 Phoebe:He has brown hair.
 Phoebe:He works with food!
 Phoebe:Obviously and he’s British.
 Phoebe:Yeah? And he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
 Phoebe:Oh I’m so sorry. Um and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again I’ll find out more.
 Phoebe:Well he may not be my soul mate but a girl’s gotta eat.
 Phoebe:Oh! Hi!
 Phoebe:Umm Chandler Monica this is Don.
 Phoebe:(mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
 Phoebe:(cough talks) Soul mate.
 Phoebe:Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…
 Phoebe:They’re just talking and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Don’t worry we’ll find you someone else.
 Phoebe:I’m so sorry.
 Phoebe:I don’t know they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.
 Phoebe:Okay so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know and-and y’know one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh I see a ladder. (Checks the book) Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm who’s next?
 Phoebe:Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm oh! Okay I see a circle.
 Phoebe:Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!
 Phoebe:Umm… Wow all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)
 Phoebe:(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. (He gets up to leave and smiles at Phoebe.)
 Phoebe:Oh hello.
 Phoebe:Oh Jim Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
 Phoebe:Well maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and the exchange information.)
 Phoebe:Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.
 Phoebe:Oh witty banter. Well done.
 Phoebe:Oh okay well I’m a masseuse and I used to work at this place…
 Phoebe:I-I-I like I like parties.
 Phoebe:Yeah I guess a little.
 Phoebe:(a little freaked out) So! Umm anyway I-I lived in New York someone wildly I guess for umm—Well since I was fourteen.
 Phoebe:Oh stop it.
 Phoebe:Okay. Umm look you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wow! You do?
 Phoebe:All right. (Gets up and walks out.)
 Phoebe:Oh there it is.
 Phoebe:I know but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store a new bank a new adult bookstore a new grocery store…
 Phoebe:A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.
 Phoebe:Yeah we both can. And we both will.
 Phoebe:Oh you didn’t have to come in with me.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh yeah well I’m sorry about that too but what are you going to do?
 Phoebe:A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now you’re talking.
 Phoebe:I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.
 Phoebe:(looking around) She must’ve left.
 Phoebe:Oh Ross Mon is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?
 Phoebe:Well his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
 Phoebe:Yeah he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life and he treats me like a queen except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Everybody this is Parker Parker this is…
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:I’ll go with you
 Phoebe:Were you guys making fun of Parker?
 Phoebe:So he a little enthusiastic what’s wrong with that?
 Phoebe:Well so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag Janice Mona? No because friends don’t do that. But do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap. (Walks off)
 Phoebe:No I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.
 Phoebe:Hm huh yeah.
 Phoebe:No that’s not necessary.
 Phoebe:No actually I don’t eat…
 Phoebe:Okay fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor) Mmm…hmmmmm….
 Phoebe:Why don’t you just try one?
 Phoebe:Then you better do it now.
 Phoebe:Because I’m going to kill him
 Phoebe:You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.
 Phoebe:Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?
 Phoebe:He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.
 Phoebe:You think?
 Phoebe:You’re right. You’re right he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny positive person.
 Phoebe:What’s that now?
 Phoebe:Oh look it’s Parker!
 Phoebe:Oooh I love it!
 Phoebe:Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
 Phoebe:Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
 Phoebe:Oh thank God.
 Phoebe:Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
 Phoebe:Let’s try something else let’s play a game.
 Phoebe:Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (Giggles)
 Phoebe:But let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights Parker!
 Phoebe:You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.
 Phoebe:No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac at Disneyland getting laid!
 Phoebe:Much less happy!
 Phoebe:So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)
 Phoebe:Uh huh. (Closes door)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)
 Phoebe:I’m gonna get some coffee anyone want anything?
 Phoebe:(interrupting him) I was just being polite!
 Phoebe:Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
 Phoebe:Umm I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
 Phoebe:Umm Phoebe Buffay.
 Phoebe:Oh okay it’s P as in Phoebe H as in hoebe O as in oebe E as in ebe B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) ‘Ello there mate!
 Phoebe:Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
 Phoebe:Ohhh.
 Phoebe:(turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey thats not a Nutter-Butter thats just an old Wonton!
 Phoebe:Ohh tough call.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
 Phoebe:Oh please!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:About twenty a couple people from work who had something else to do.
 Phoebe:Well I don’t I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…
 Phoebe:No. (Pause) Neither is mine.
 Phoebe:I know. I know what’s her number?
 Phoebe:Isn’t it at three?
 Phoebe:Oh I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?
 Phoebe:What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi Mrs. Green!
 Phoebe:I’m so glad you could make it.
 Phoebe:Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
 Phoebe:No look we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
 Phoebe:For how long?
 Phoebe:She can’t hear you.
 Phoebe:Well if you don’t want your mother to move in with you just tell her.
 Phoebe:I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!
 Phoebe:How about you less important people let’s open your presents!
 Phoebe:Okay come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.
 Phoebe:Okay this is from your friend at work.
 Phoebe:Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
 Phoebe:Not if you were here.
 Phoebe:No not a thing.
 Phoebe:Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely albeit slightly boring shower and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.
 Phoebe:Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her I’d tell her off.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh!
 Phoebe:(To Monica) Wrap it up wrap it up wrap it up…
 Phoebe:You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!
 Phoebe:You should be!
 Phoebe:You got it!
 Phoebe:Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
 Phoebe:Hey! Oh how did baby shopping go?
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Well did she know you two weren’t married?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man we-we must alert the church elders!
 Phoebe:Sounds like you’re a little jealous.
 Phoebe:Is that a real place? (Rachel’s stunned) Are they hiring?
 Phoebe:Hey Chandler why so fancy?
 Phoebe:Wait I think I know someone who does that.
 Phoebe:Yeah just don’t get your hopes up.
 Phoebe:Well the interview…
 Phoebe:Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.
 Phoebe:Oh you don’t know.
 Phoebe:Yes when I first met you you were like Blah blah blah. I was like shhh!
 Phoebe:Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes y’know you just—You come off a little needy.
 Phoebe:Oh! It’s okay you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
 Phoebe:All right don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
 Phoebe:I can’t help you.
 Phoebe:All right all right we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. Hi! Come on in I’m uh Regina Philange.
 Phoebe:Bing what an unusual name.
 Phoebe:Um-hmm that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do and start focusing on what you do do.
 Phoebe:I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
 Phoebe:You gotta go!
 Phoebe:Okay don’t worry. You’re ready.
 Phoebe:Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.
 Phoebe:I started that!
 Phoebe:Oh I know I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…
 Phoebe:Or you can do volunteer work.
 Phoebe:Joey you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe Phoebe.
 Phoebe:(still mimicking a heartbeat only faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)
 Phoebe:Mon maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
 Phoebe:When she comes out you hold her nose I’ll blow in her mouth and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
 Phoebe:I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.
 Phoebe:You’re on!
 Phoebe:One hundred thousand dollars!
 Phoebe:Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.
 Phoebe:No one’s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!
 Phoebe:Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh you’re still pregnant. Oh I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah like fifty bucks.
 Phoebe:It’s interesting that you lost. Now I forget do you like to lose?
 Phoebe:Fine! You’re on!
 Phoebe:Until then General Grant why don’t you set up camp (She puts the bill in her bra) right there.
 Phoebe:Good God man don’t anger it.
 Phoebe:Oh I-I don’t know about that. No I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
 Phoebe:Thank you!
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Is Rachel having the baby?
 Phoebe:They’re at the coffeehouse.
 Phoebe:We know it’s a girl! (Exits.)
 Phoebe:Oh you made it!
 Phoebe:(looking at the clock) Oh wow three hours and still no baby. Ugh the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
 Phoebe:Sure! What?
 Phoebe:Oh this is fun.
 Phoebe:Yeah. (Pause) Why aren’t you with Rachel?
 Phoebe:But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
 Phoebe:Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)
 Phoebe:I know!
 Phoebe:Oh it ate your money?
 Phoebe:All right I’ll see you downstairs then.
 Phoebe:All right.
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button but can’t.) I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)
 Phoebe:Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
 Phoebe:Well it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about you?
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
 Phoebe:Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
 Phoebe:(to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm he’s like early to mid-thirties very attractive.
 Phoebe:Oh yay! Great! Okay what room number is he in?
 Phoebe:Hands.
 Phoebe:Thank you. (Starts to exit.)
 Phoebe:(coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)
 Phoebe:Ooh this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh that’s him! That’s him!
 Phoebe:Wait a second or maybe you can go in first.
 Phoebe:No not you Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.
 Phoebe:But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
 Phoebe:What else? What else?
 Phoebe:Oh. Ah-uh.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Enter Pheebs.
 Phoebe:Okay I’ve got one for you if you had too which one would you rather eat a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
 Phoebe:Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it? I’m sorry. (She moves her arm which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)
 Phoebe:Oh I’ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)
 Phoebe:Relax it’s not like we’re forking.
 Phoebe:Y’know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as Cliff sees something on TV.)
 Phoebe:Huh. Okay Mr. Perkazet.
 Phoebe:Cliff do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
 Phoebe:Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.
 Phoebe:You’re right that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just can we just start over?
 Phoebe:Uh Joey we’re trying to dial down the crazy.
 Phoebe:Umm look we don’t we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.
 Phoebe:Can we come in?
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Oh she’s so beautiful.
 Phoebe:Okay my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You’re so cute! Oh I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won’t.
 Phoebe:Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)
 Phoebe:Oh wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
 Phoebe:Yay!
 Phoebe:Is she in there?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:I just can’t decide who she looks more alike you or Rachel?
 Phoebe:I’m sorry for the last time why aren’t you two together again? (Silence from Ross.) No I know. I know because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine except you totally are.
 Phoebe:Yeah that’s true. Yeah you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
 Phoebe:I know. I know. I know. I know and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
 Phoebe:Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.
 Phoebe:(To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
 Phoebe:To see if know what these guys are talking about.
 Phoebe:(taking Ross aside) Have umm have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
 Phoebe:Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow you could’ve done that with us there.
 Phoebe:Oh sure okay you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.
 Phoebe:Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Are you all right?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! He did it?
 Phoebe:Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
 Phoebe:I just talked him into it don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
 Phoebe:Why?! You two are so meant to be together everybody thinks so.
 Phoebe:Especially Ross!
 Phoebe:There he goes your fianc�e.
 Phoebe:Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
 Phoebe:Oh hey! Wait up!
 Phoebe:Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.
 Phoebe:No! No that you and Rachel are engaged!
 Phoebe:Oh it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.
 Phoebe:Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
 Phoebe:All right me too. (They go into her room and see that she’s sleeping.) Should we wake her up?
 Phoebe:And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
 Phoebe:Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:So whose ring is it?
 Phoebe:Is it an engagement ring?
 Phoebe:But you didn’t give it to her?
 Phoebe:But you were going to propose?
 Phoebe:Huh I might be losing interest in this.
 Phoebe:Oh what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
 Phoebe:No! No she said you actually proposed to her.
 Phoebe:No they ran out of It’s a girl but I can fix this one (She writes not in between it’s and a) See?
 Phoebe:Look at all the stuff people sent!
 Phoebe:She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
 Phoebe:Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!
 Phoebe:I dunno well he got over the We were on a break thing really quickly.
 Phoebe:You know that’s… that’s her.
 Phoebe:Oh no Rach no no you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
 Phoebe:I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.
 Phoebe:It really does… how long do you think we have to stay?
 Phoebe:Well alright we already tried feeding her changing her burping her oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
 Phoebe:Yeah no kidding this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
 Phoebe:Alright you guys we can’t turn on each other Okay?  That’s just what she wants.
 Phoebe:Oh I’m kinda part of this.
 Phoebe:I knew I should have married Chandler.
 Phoebe:Well alright looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her upset and Monica just stares.) No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)
 Phoebe:Alright I’ll try fine! Yes Okay!
 Phoebe:Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
 Phoebe:I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
 Phoebe:(entering) Have I gone deaf?
 Phoebe:You must be a fireball in bed.
 Phoebe:I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I’m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
 Phoebe:Thankfully you don’t need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let’s give it six to eight months (she leaves).

 Phoebe:Bye Chandler.
 Phoebe:Okay bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)
 Phoebe:Oh hey Ross oh Im so glad someones here could you zip me up?

 Phoebe:oh umm Mikes picking me up for a date.
 Phoebe:oh I dunno I dunno you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
 Phoebe:yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
 Phoebe:I wouldnt say never you know theres that guy (pause) well what about (pause) ok well theres gotta be someone.
 Phoebe:Oh my god youre right.
 Phoebe:I cant believe I never realized this before Im in my thirtys and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god (starts crying) whats wrong with me.
 Phoebe:I wanna get married (grabs a tissue)
 Phoebe:least youve been married OH MY GOD! I wanna trade lives with Ross (cries more)
 Phoebe:nothing Im excited about our date Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa (starts crying)
 Phoebe:uh huh (terns to Ross) how do I look (all her make up has gone everywhere)
 Phoebe:(goes to cry) No
 Phoebe:well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
 Phoebe:would you call this girl? (Puts on a crying act) thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing
 Phoebe:well you not what you should feel terrible about this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
 Phoebe:Its open.
 Phoebe:HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY! (She dances around with happiness)
 Phoebe:What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
 Phoebe:WHAT!
 Phoebe:WHAT! WHY?
 Phoebe:(Walks towards Ross) If you hadnt just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
 Phoebe:Im not going along with some lie you made Ross No Im just gonna be honest with him.
 Phoebe:yeah Ive nothing to be ashamed of ok so I havent been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I havent had a real boyfriend you know if he cant handle that he can leave. which he will and thats ok. so Ill just be alone forever you know alright Ill be. itll be fine. itll be fine. Ill go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh (takes a deep breath and sits down knock on the door)
 Phoebe:ok
 Phoebe:Uh huh yeah (stands up) theres just something umm theres something you should know (Pause) Vicrum just called.
 Phoebe:.and I said Vicrum you cant just call every time you get lonely you know you you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
 Phoebe:yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emmas birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
 Phoebe:I know but he calls and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:ok I cant do this.
 Phoebe:well there is no Vicrum Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship Ive never lived with a guy and Ive never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if thats too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact Ill close my eyes make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses her Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me.
 Phoebe:so you dont think Im a total freak
 Phoebe:I guess so can I. can I think its cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls back) and umm be a little concerned about the magic markers.
 Phoebe:you know maybe this is a wake up call about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirtys and youve never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship here you go from woman to woman meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesnt tern into anything serious.
 Phoebe:Oh hey you guys I couldn�t get a reservation for the night of my birthday so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
 Phoebe:So?
 Phoebe:No! It�s my first birthday with a boyfriend and he has to work. Uch I get mad at him but I think it�s a little to soon to show my true colors.
 Phoebe:Oh Rachel!
 Phoebe:Oh yay!
 Phoebe:Alright okay so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey you know what? We all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.
 Phoebe:(from outside) Trick or treat! (It�s obviously Halloween eve the night of her birthday dinner.)
 Phoebe:Ooh and treat it is. (Monica�s breasts.)
 Phoebe:Wow so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can�t contain my breasts.
 Phoebe:Ohh. Oh wait! (Jis) you guys won�t be late for my dinner will you?
 Phoebe:�kay see you there. Happy humping! (outside meeting Chandler.) Hey�hey! Oh wow somebody smoked out here? Oh my god don�t people know you�re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
 Phoebe:You smoked!
 Phoebe:(smells at him) Chandler you stink of cigarettes.
 Phoebe:Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound � and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
 Phoebe:(embarrassed) I�m gonna go. (leaves to stairs)
 Phoebe:Where is everyone? They�re forty minutes late.
 Phoebe:I�m starving. I know we were coming here tonight I ate nothing all day.
 Phoebe:Yes they are expected presently. Yeah yeah um their arrival is in the offing.
 Phoebe:Joseph! (to waiter) Thou needn�t worry they shan�t be long.
 Phoebe:One really does have a stick up one�s ass. Doesn�t one?
 Phoebe:No you can�t go. No-no-no I can�t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move I cave.
 Phoebe:Okay fine I�ll move. Alright you don�t have to manhandle me. (gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you. Wach.
 Phoebe:Well I guess they�re not coming. You wanna just order?
 Phoebe:Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
 Phoebe:Both it is thank you.
 Phoebe:You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
 Phoebe:And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
 Phoebe:Wher-where have you been?
 Phoebe:You guys we�ve been waiting for you for a long time maybe you should order.
 Phoebe:Aw � what?
 Phoebe:�s a good toast.
 Phoebe:(getting up) Oh for god�s sake Judy pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) I�m sorry was that rude? Di-did my my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look I know you all have a lot going on but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn�t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well it�s too late now.
 Phoebe:well this is this is this is not over! (on phone) Hello?
 Phoebe:(returns) Okay that was Mike.
 Phoebe:Mhuh guys that means the world to me. Huh nkay I�m gonna take off.
 Phoebe:Oh I love you guys too but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.
 Phoebe:I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar shakes it and then realises she cant open it with one hand but doesnt want to let go of Mikes hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
 Phoebe:Yeah I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well hows this? (she takes Mikes hand and puts it on her breast she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that they hold hands again. Joey now enters and sees the two sitting on the couch holding hands.)
 Phoebe:Im sorry... Im sorry. Its obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
 Phoebe:(in a flash she answers) Maybe not is it?
 Phoebe:(impatient) I know Mike why dont you keep digging?
 Phoebe:Oh its a key. To be honest I think Id prefer the five dollars.
 Phoebe:(really surprised) Oh wow ooh! Ooh big step for Phoebe and Mike.
 Phoebe:Oh no I want to.
 Phoebe:Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think Id never meet someone that you know I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)
 Phoebe:It really is.
 Phoebe:(gasps) Oh my God! David!
 Phoebe:(excited) No! Its a great time come in...! WOW hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
 Phoebe:Who cares it got you here.
 Phoebe:Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)
 Phoebe:A-Allright well... Ill call the cab company.
 Phoebe:Thank you! God no! You should see me when... Oh actually no I look pretty good.
 Phoebe:No...
 Phoebe:Im... Im just... Im the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that Im seeing Mike?
 Phoebe:He said Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
 Phoebe:Yeah! I mean I dont know. I was just  I was looking I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking Oh my God! Its David. Davids here. Hes just hes so irresistible.
 Phoebe:Really? Chandler?
 Phoebe:Oh.Okay then it gets worse cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
 Phoebe:I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much you know. Its just going really well. Oh my God!
 Phoebe:(sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...! you know. And given my life long search for irony you can imagine how happy I am.
 Phoebe:I mean I guess I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I dont... You know complicated moral situation no right no wrong...
 Phoebe:Okay I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Okay. (and she walks away)
 Phoebe:No but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
 Phoebe:Oof...
 Phoebe:Oh wait wait!
 Phoebe:No no its not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
 Phoebe:Yeah I should have told you.
 Phoebe:Im sorry Im sorry.
 Phoebe:I am happy.
 Phoebe:Well... but David just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things Ive ever had to do.
 Phoebe:Of course yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know a kiss on the cheek wouldnt be totally inappropriate...
 Phoebe:I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek makes his way to the door and turns around again)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Well if thats what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... its... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
 Phoebe:Hmmm... No no... No I cant do this. Its bad.
 Phoebe:No no. No.
 Phoebe:Look David if... if you had never left then... yeah wed probably still be together right now but... you did leave and I-Im with Mike and I really care about him...
 Phoebe:(points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
 Phoebe:No no no no no... Its not... its not... its not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
 Phoebe:No uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago and he lives in Minsk. Hes only... hes only in town for a couple of days.
 Phoebe:No no...
 Phoebe:Oh well yeah...
 Phoebe:Stop it! Stop it before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets Davids jacket and gives it to him) Here David you should just go.
 Phoebe:Okay well... guys?
 Phoebe:Im sorry Im so sorry. If you... If you want your key back I totally understand.
 Phoebe:Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.)
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Listen! You have to help me pick a dress cause Im meeting Mikes parents tonight! (Rachel gasps)
 Phoebe:(sarcastically) Really? That hadnt occurred to me.
 Phoebe:They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
 Phoebe:Okay so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up two Phoebe dresses Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time dont wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say neither.
 Phoebe:So... now... What about with Mikes mom?
 Phoebe:(speaking louder and articulating) Thats shes like the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks at Phoebe in a duh! way)
 Phoebe:Im wearing pantyhose!
 Phoebe:Oh thank you! Oh... Oh my God youre RICH!
 Phoebe:Yeah so... They gotta die someday. (Mikes parents walk in) HELLO!
 Phoebe:(in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
 Phoebe:And you... Your home is lovely.
 Phoebe:Holy crap!
 Phoebe:Oh try and stop me!
 Phoebe:(no accent) Im trying to get your parents to like me.
 Phoebe:(accent) Got it! It... Its hard to stop...
 Phoebe:(no accent) Uhm... Okay well allright uhm... Originally Im from upstate but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay that was okay until uhm... I got hepatitis you know cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway now Im uhm... a freelance massage therapist uhm... which you know isnt always steady money but at least I dont pay taxes huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit surreal which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) So... where does everyone summer?
 Phoebe:God! God! This is not going well.
 Phoebe:Okay okay okay okay... Still sure about me being myself?
 Phoebe:So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
 Phoebe:Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
 Phoebe:Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right in the stomach)
 Phoebe:Oh my God are you okay?
 Phoebe:Im so sorry!
 Phoebe:I really really am sorry.
 Phoebe:Yes... Im sorry Ive never met a boyfriends parents before...
 Phoebe:Yeah okay... yeah your mom... okay... She looks nice I can talk to her.
 Phoebe:Yeah... Oh Bitsy hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
 Phoebe:Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
 Phoebe:Well and you know it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because hes very respectful of women.
 Phoebe:Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... youd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
 Phoebe:(Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no no no no no no. Dont get me wrong. No hes not in like a sissy way. No no no... when he gets going he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
 Phoebe:...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat Sme-lly ca-t / I-ts not your fau-lt. And thats the end of the song... I realise that you didnt ask to hear it but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
 Phoebe:Oh Pervert Parade?
 Phoebe:Oh Ode To A Pubic Hair?
 Phoebe:Oh God! Is that veal?
 Phoebe:Oh no no no no... Thats okay thats okay... I mean Im... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no veal I love...
 Phoebe:No no no I actually its any baby animals kittens fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this this nice vein of fat running through it... (she cuts the meat picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth which she keeps closed trying to overcome her vegetarian thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... Clearly not enjoying the meat...) Hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it except Mike. Hes making a hmmmm.... face... Then Phoebe swallows it) Hmmm... (at first she likes it but then in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. You hear a door slamming.)
 Phoebe:Yeah... The woman you what?
 Phoebe:I love you too...
 Phoebe:YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss)
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:I had a great time. (accent) It was really top drawer. And heres something rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...

 Phoebe:Oh okay. How about the whole man walking on the moon thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
 Phoebe:Ooh honey. You stink at lying.
 Phoebe:Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house I went to the bathroom and when I came back my muffin was gone-who took it?
 Phoebe:Dont worry dont worry. Well come up with a good lie. Ill help you practice it.
 Phoebe:Sure what.. what was the work thing?
 Phoebe:Pick up grandma at the airport?
 Phoebe:Oh right ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when youre talking people know youre lying.
 Phoebe:Thats a great movie. <she claps>
 Phoebe:PHOE-BE.
 Phoebe:Theres your movie! <claps>
 Phoebe:Its ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. Its easy to remember and doesnt invite a lot of questions. You werent at the parade because you had a family emergency.
 Phoebe:Ooh what happened?
 Phoebe:No! Nothing with a raccoon.
 Phoebe:Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
 Phoebe:Oh my god! Shouldnt we stop this?
 Phoebe:Its all right. You can mourn.

 Phoebe:Joey can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
 Phoebe:Im sorry its just Im a little short on cash. 
 Phoebe:Oh no no no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No thats why Richard Dreyfuss and I dont speak anymore.

 Phoebe:Okay from the top people!
 Phoebe:Joey listen. I cant do this it doesnt make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse and today Im a waitress at a cafe?
 Phoebe:Well its not okay because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly Im the waitress? Thats gonna confuse my fans. 
 Phoebe:Uhuh. Because Im a single mother supporting my two children.
 Phoebe:Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldnt I come over to say hi to him?
 Phoebe:About what?
 Phoebe:And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
 Phoebe:Yeah well Im very angry at him because he slept with me and never called me back.
 Phoebe:I cant do that. Im an actor. I have a process.
 Phoebe:Wait a minute I see whats happening here. Youre threatened. 
 Phoebe:Yeah Im so good in this scene that Im stealing focus from you. Well rise to the challenge Tribianni cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
 Phoebe:Hey Mike whats the capital of Peru?
 Phoebe:No. It starts with a v and ends with an x. Helpfully with a to in the middle.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:(relived) Oh whew no thats Bob.
 Phoebe:Well not so much a pet as you know an occasional visitor who I put food out for you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesnt poop on the plate of cookies.
 Phoebe:What are those?
 Phoebe:OK fine if it means that much to you Ill get rid of Bob.
 Phoebe:So weird you think hes so gross and youre willing to eat his crackers. (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)
 Phoebe:Hey Mikey
 Phoebe:What are you doing?
 Phoebe:To kill Bob??
 Phoebe:No Mike I dont want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and and you know set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
 Phoebe:Ill find Bob Ill get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at cabinet under sink) Oh wait I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bobs a mom!
 Phoebe:I dont know I kinda like Bob for a girl.
 Phoebe:Oh my god we killed Bob!
 Phoebe:Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
 Phoebe:Be careful be careful! These are my rat babies!
 Phoebe:I had to bring them! We killed their mother theyre our responsibility now. You know they require constant care. You should know that Rachel youre a mother.
 Phoebe:No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home we need feed them.
 Phoebe:Well Im sorry Rachel but Im not like you ok? Not everyone can afford help. (she and Mike leave)
 Phoebe:Ok ok you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
 Phoebe:Well you know what theyre our responsibility now.
 Phoebe:Mate? Theyre all brothers and sisters.
 Phoebe:No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? Thats like ... (starts counting with her fingers) Thats math I cant even do! What are we gonna do?
 Phoebe:Yeah ok. I guess youre right. Allright so we should just give them away. But to nice families with children and reduced fat wheat thins. Theyre Bobs favorites.
 Phoebe:You must think Im crazy.
 Phoebe:Good. Its just so hard its hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories you know from ... when I gave birth to my brothers triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I havent told you about that yet have I?
 Phoebe:(walks in) Hey
 Phoebe:Listen I think Ive left something here.
 Phoebe:(likes the jacket) No but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
 Phoebe:(realizes) Ooh maybe thats him!
 Phoebe:Well it depends.
 Phoebe:On how far along hes in the sex change process!
 Phoebe:Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
 Phoebe:Wow! Talking about high maintenance
 Phoebe:Im a woman!
 Phoebe:Oh before I forget are you coming to Mikes piano bar tonight?
 Phoebe:But everybody sings. Its so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there forgot all of the words flipped out
 Phoebe:Oh! Whats the matter? Are you scared? Youre afraid Im a better singer? Youre afraid Im gonna beat you at singing?
 Phoebe:OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You dont have to sing.
 Phoebe:While drinking...
 Phoebe:Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
 Phoebe:Oh my god.
 Phoebe:It was the end of the party you were probably ironing wrapping paper.

 Phoebe:Every little bit of you!
 Phoebe:Mon not that you didn�t sound good but...
 Phoebe:Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
 Phoebe:Yes she gives the people what they want.
 Phoebe:Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didnt see that before I wouldnt have let her go up again.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:What you got?
 Phoebe:Goodie! Thanks. So how is it living with Rachel again? I mean apart from the great food.
 Phoebe:Oh my god Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
 Phoebe:I dont know. Theyre so perfect for each other; its crazy.
 Phoebe:I just wish theyd realise they should be together.
 Phoebe:I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
 Phoebe:You know what? Maybe once they start dating and they see whats out there theyll realise how good they are for each other.
 Phoebe:So what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
 Phoebe:Yeah. (BEAT) Oh I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates so that theyll realise how good they are together.
 Phoebe:Yeah you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my plan-laugh. (A maniacal laugh follows.)
 Phoebe:Ooh Joey.
 Phoebe:Hey. Im so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
 Phoebe:Well its this guy I used to massage. And by massage I mean hold down so he wouldnt turn over and flash me.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah.
 Phoebe:A teacher?
 Phoebe:Well Ross does. What... Youre - youre ruining the plan! Joey youve - youve fixed him up with his perfect woman!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:How do you even know a woman like that?
 Phoebe:Joey.
 Phoebe:So now what do we do?
 Phoebe:What if we dont find him somebody else? Well just tell her the dates off but we dont tell Ross and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
 Phoebe:Ooh so this is great! Rachels gonna have a terrible date Ross gets stood up and then theyll realise how good they have it together.
 Phoebe:Its not Santas plan. No its... (Laughs the real plan-laugh.)
 Phoebe:No I think we killed it.
 Phoebe:Hello?
 Phoebe:Hey Rach!
 Phoebe:You know you are talking about one of my dear dear friends.
 Phoebe:Oh right so he gets a little crazy when hes stoned.
 Phoebe:Did he go out for a cigarette?
 Phoebe:My dear sweet Rach.
 Phoebe:By the time anyones figured out what weve done well be in sunny Mexico. (BEAT) Oh wait thats the end of a different plan.
 Phoebe:Now wait a minute. So theyre gonna name their first child Joey?
 Phoebe:How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
 Phoebe:Oh so they owe me like three Phoebes.
 Phoebe:Oh my god! Look its Ross and Rachel. Oh the plan is working.
 Phoebe:Dont dont do the plan-laugh.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah theyre falling in love all over again.
 Phoebe:Oh they see us! Oh they they look mad. Oh they figured it out. Theyre coming this way. Run!

 Phoebe:Oh I hear divorce bells. 
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Lowell is that you?
 Phoebe:(simultaneously) Oh my god! 
 Phoebe:(excited) Im sorry Ross this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell Ross.

 Phoebe:Good for you! 
 Phoebe:Ouh… (she nods)
 Phoebe:Excuse me Ross old friends catching up…
 Phoebe:Im sorry I have friends outside the six of us. 
 Phoebe:Well Im not proud of it but you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…
 Phoebe:Well ok I wasnt rich like you guys ok I didnt eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life my mother was killed by a drug dealer…

 Phoebe:No… actually you might wanna stay away from Jane street… thats where stabby Joe works. 
 Phoebe:Okay I think we have a problem here. 
 Phoebe:Well uhm back in my mugging days you know I uhm I worked St. Marcs Comics.

 Phoebe:Yes it was. 
 Phoebe:(interrupting pinching his year) Gimme your money punk!
 Phoebe:(apologetic) Yeah and Im so so sorry Ross Im sorry but you know if you think about it its kinda neat. (She smiles at him but he doesnt understand) I mean well its just that I Ive always felt kinda like an outsider you know the rest of you have these connections that go way back and you know now you and I have… have a great one! 
 Phoebe:I know Im sorry please forgive me. I dont know what to say…
 Phoebe:Really? Even more humiliating than…
 Phoebe:Hey Ross! (He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her) I know youre still mad at me but can I just talk to you for a second? 
 Phoebe:I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think youll find very exciting. 
 Phoebe:Look Ross in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke. (Ross looks at her in astonishment) Anyway I was looking through it and I found Science Boy (She holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to Ross)
 Phoebe:I cant say I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. 
 Phoebe:Yeah… but you should know I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. 
 Phoebe:Youre welcome. And thank you for Science Boy. I learned a lot from him 
 Phoebe:Why??
 Phoebe:Oh...you dont have to go I have something that will fit you.
 Phoebe:I want you to stay.
 Phoebe:Why dont you turn them inside ou...
 Phoebe:Ill miss you.
 Phoebe:Great! Ok...Ill go get the tube top.
 Phoebe:Wow Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say Hell yeah!
 Phoebe:Yeah! Lets do it! Lets live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses Phoebe) Oh god were really going to move in together!
 Phoebe:Ive always wanted to live with a guy. Pick up your socks! Put down the toilet seat! No! Were not having sex anymore! Its gonna be fun!
 Phoebe:Hey you guys! Ok weve got great news.
 Phoebe:I know its so exciting! You know Ive never lived with a guy before.
 Phoebe:Okay well you put down the toilet seat.
 Phoebe:Uh huh...were playing you two.
 Phoebe:Monica slow down! Ok? Im just excited to be living with him. You know I mean I dont know Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Yknow..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
 Phoebe:I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
 Phoebe:Yeah! You bet roomy!
 Phoebe:Oh please these guys we havent even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)
 Phoebe:China patterns!!!!!
 Phoebe:Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase its a play on the word roomy.
 Phoebe:Oh no! No no! Not at all. Were just moving in right now. See where it goes.
 Phoebe:What do you mean?
 Phoebe:Oh. Wow.
 Phoebe:Was it really that bad?
 Phoebe:Ok well thats bad. But dont you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
 Phoebe:But its just...
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:No! I definitely dont wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didnt want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind theres gonna be hell to pay mister!
 Phoebe:Yeah I get that.
 Phoebe:Hi
 Phoebe:Listen I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
 Phoebe:No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
 Phoebe:Mike doesnt ever wanna get married.
 Phoebe:Never.
 Phoebe:I want to but I just want you to tell me that marriage isnt really that big a deal. You know that I wont I wont be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
 Phoebe:Thats not how you really feel is it?
 Phoebe:Seriously? You divorce-o?
 Phoebe:Its ok thats how you feel.
 Phoebe:I do love Mike.
 Phoebe:Yeah I guess youre right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
 Phoebe:Its not cooler.
 Phoebe:Better.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah no thanks you.
 Phoebe:What do you mean?
 Phoebe:They are awfully boxy...
 Phoebe:Uh huh.
 Phoebe:Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... theres no wiggle room? None at all?
 Phoebe:Right. Except that I do want to get married.
 Phoebe:Someday.
 Phoebe:I havent exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now its my turn some of the regular stuff.
 Phoebe:Because I just didnt know how much I wanted it. And I love you and I wanted to live with you.
 Phoebe:But I dont think I can! it was ok to move in when I didnt know what was gonna happen but I cant move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
 Phoebe:Are you gonna change yours?
 Phoebe:Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
 Phoebe:I dont want it to end either.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:Breaking up sucks! Oh I really miss Mike!
 Phoebe:Oh God I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I cant think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica I really need your help getting through this...
 Phoebe:Well no when I get to the point where... you know... Im ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... Im gonna come to you.
 Phoebe:Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know Mike never wants to get married and I shouldnt be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon Im gonna miss him so much. Im gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
 Phoebe:(after a pause) Unless... Maybe its too crazy about this... Alright so... you know there is no future... but that doesnt mean we still cant have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
 Phoebe:That was a test and you just failed.
 Phoebe:God I wish Mike were here.
 Phoebe:I gotta call him. Just to talk to him theres no harm in that.
 Phoebe:Here.
 Phoebe:Okay (she takes a huge clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)
 Phoebe:Yes.
 Phoebe:Yes it reminds me of a simpler time.
 Phoebe:You cant have it.
 Phoebe:No (tucks it in her pants)
 Phoebe:(disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
 Phoebe:Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
 Phoebe:You know its a lot less surprising to do that after Ive buzzed you into the building.
 Phoebe:Those are my shoes.
 Phoebe:Monica I really appreciate you checking in on me but Im actually feeling a lot better. Yeah I just kinda want to be alone right now.
 Phoebe:I ordered Chinese food.
 Phoebe:What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
 Phoebe:Im sorry I broke down... I wanted to see him.
 Phoebe:There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
 Phoebe:Not if nothing happens. Why cant... why cant we just hang out as friends?
 Phoebe:Sit down.
 Phoebe:Thanks you look good too.
 Phoebe:So hows the piano playing going?
 Phoebe:Ive missed you too.
 Phoebe:I know I want that too but IS that going to make it too hard?
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)
 Phoebe:Who is this?
 Phoebe:Hey will you get me tickets too?
 Phoebe:You dont wanna win the lottery?
 Phoebe:(excited)Hey you guys! Ok youre not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
 Phoebe:Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. Its really not fair either! You know just because we dont eat the meat doesnt mean we dont like to play with the carcasses!
 Phoebe:I hope I win!
 Phoebe:One two three!
 Phoebe:Get a room!
 Phoebe:Oooh I like that daddy (in a sexy tone)
 Phoebe:(still in sexy tone) Oooh is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
 Phoebe:Ok well are all the tickets in the bowl?
 Phoebe:Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
 Phoebe:Oh you guys! Weve got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)
 Phoebe:(she takes the bowl from Rachels hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!
 Phoebe:(keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she stops) Fine I cant take it anymore! Im putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)
 Phoebe:If we are not doing it together were not doing it at all! So say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).
 Phoebe:Dont come any closer!
 Phoebe:No whats more important your friends or money?
 Phoebe:Hey Monica what about your extra tickets?
 Phoebe:Ok good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down scaring Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God no! (pause) I think I broke your bowl.
 Phoebe:What a beautiful night to be running around the street looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
 Phoebe:So what? Monica we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win remember?
 Phoebe:As a matter of fact she said thats how I am going to die. (pause ) So excuse me for being a little skittish.
 Phoebe:Well I bet that was very hard for him to do.
 Phoebe:Guys the drawing is about to start!
 Phoebe:Im still looking through mine...
 Phoebe:You guys what was the Powerball number again?
 Phoebe:We won.
 Phoebe:We won!
 Phoebe:Dont tear it.
 Phoebe:I know that but look weve got the Powerball number weve won 3 dollars!
 Phoebe:(still very excited) I dont care Ive never won anything before I cant believe this!
 Phoebe:Its not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
 Phoebe:I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).
 Phoebe:(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the pigeon voice from before) Coo again. Dont blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me the pigeon coo! (pause) Seriously stop staring at her.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:Well I cant give you a massage because my licence has been revoked again!
 Phoebe:Well it was an accident...You know its a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
 Phoebe:Oh no!You guys arent supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
 Phoebe:Oh good!Ok good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
 Phoebe:And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
 Phoebe:(playing guitar and singing) And theres a country called Argentinaaaa its a place Ive never seeeeen. But Im told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!
 Phoebe:Well you said that you had customers lined up in the street so I am here to entertain!
 Phoebe:Yeah! It really has been great too you know some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah You suck and shut up and go home.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:But what?
 Phoebe:(pause) Ok say no more.
 Phoebe:(with a fancy dress still playing and singing) It wasnt just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasnt just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica showing her dress) Classy uh?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Here Monica look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
 Phoebe:Right yeah ok Ill ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
 Phoebe:Oh ok. Fine Ill just Ill take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
 Phoebe:My songs arent good enough for your restaurant?
 Phoebe:Then whats wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
 Phoebe:Yeah well excuse me I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer but (peering through her spectacles) I cant see it I cant see it!
 Phoebe:Well...its not about quality.
 Phoebe:Well at least all my songs dont taste like garlic. Yeah there are other ingredients Monica.
 Phoebe:Ear plugs or cloves of garlic?
 Phoebe:What are people having the garlic Martini?
 Phoebe:(singing) Food here at Javu..will kill you..the food here at Javu ...will kill you..
 Phoebe:Youd better get back in that kitchen Monica the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
 Phoebe:Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
 Phoebe:(while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
 Phoebe:Ok ok how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!
 Phoebe:Ok well who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
 Phoebe:Ok well alright who thinks the food is fine the music was fine but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
 Phoebe:Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friends cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
 Phoebe:Im sorry too... (they hug)
 Phoebe:Yeah! As long as its free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
 Phoebe:(smiling raising her hand) Whos hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you wont hate me?
 Phoebe:What is it?
 Phoebe:I know I know we can drive we can vote we can work what more do these broads want?
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Oh youre a paleonthologist too! (pause) Oh ok now what do you think of Ranions new theory of species variegation in segmented arthopods?
 Phoebe:Ah ah.
 Phoebe:Yeah I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
 Phoebe:Joeys having a party and he wasnt gonna invite us?
 Phoebe:And that horrible museum tour!
 Phoebe:We know about your party Joey.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Monica you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)
 Phoebe:Hey Ross!
 Phoebe:Oh Whats the matter?
 Phoebe:Worse?
 Phoebe:(still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoths tusks)
 Phoebe:Hey Ross! So listen about you and the dinosaur girl are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that come on a piece of paper?
 Phoebe:Go Charlie! But my point is ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe shes looking to you know slum it with some average Joe Phd.
 Phoebe:Youre so much more than just brains! Youre sweet and kind and funny...
 Phoebe:Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
 Phoebe:Good for you! And hey I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
 Phoebe:Hey thank you so much for these tickets Chandler.
 Phoebe:Wow Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joeys raw sexual magnetism... Oh those nerds will get laaaaaid!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
 Phoebe:I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
 Phoebe:Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
 Phoebe:(coming back from the bathroom) Whats up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachels hands) Hey Rachel!!
 Phoebe:No you cant go there! You know how I feel about these big massage places! Theyre putting people like me out of business!
 Phoebe:Ok this is not about the MONEY ok? Its about... its about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
 Phoebe:Well do you care about friendship?
 Phoebe:I feel really strongly about this Rachel. Please dont use this gift certificate. Im asking you as a friend.
 Phoebe:Promise?
 Phoebe:Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
 Phoebe:Ok. Do we have to talk like that then theyre not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh no no! Listen is there someone who can fill in for me?
 Phoebe:But that woman cant know I work here. Shes a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
 Phoebe:Cause its good money! But that doesnt change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
 Phoebe:(watching around and whispering) Ok are they listening?
 Phoebe:(In a strange heavy accent) Hello ja its time for your massage ja! Put your face in the hole.
 Phoebe:Okay then Im Swedish...
 Phoebe:Its a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
 Phoebe:Ja!
 Phoebe:(pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
 Phoebe:Is something wrong?
 Phoebe:(Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
 Phoebe:(Singing) Ipan Stripan Glupi Glabi!  And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
 Phoebe:Oh Ja! Ja!
 Phoebe:Uhu uhu... and why do you think that is?
 Phoebe:Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because youre such a high maintenance tight ass!
 Phoebe:You know its me?
 Phoebe:How can you come here?
 Phoebe:I dont have to tell you everything!
 Phoebe:Tips not included.
 Phoebe:Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical and dental and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now Im this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
 Phoebe:You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. Its time I took my life back!
 Phoebe:Ok.
 Phoebe:Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too I didnt mean any of that. I love you.
 Phoebe:(imitating the receptionists tone) Good morning receptionist.
 Phoebe:Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch she came back?
 Phoebe:(through the door with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole lassy.
 Phoebe:(entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok great! All right bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others then back at the phone) Thats off right?
 Phoebe:Oh... Mikes sister just invited me to a party tonight hes gonna be there. And she was like Oh dont worry! I asked him. Hes totally ok with seeing you!. So now I have to go so hell think that Im totally ok with seeing him!
 Phoebe:Exactly!
 Phoebe:(after a short pause) I didnt even think about that! (pause) Aaargh sexual politics!!
 Phoebe:Ok thatll be great!
 Phoebe:Oh Ill take some of that.
 Phoebe:No I know this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause Im gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.
 Phoebe:Ok. Oh good Im dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
 Phoebe:(picks up a dress) Hey Rach will you come with me to a dressing room?
 Phoebe:Ok!
 Phoebe:So what were you doing out there do you not like Charlie?
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:Who else?
 Phoebe:You like Joey?
 Phoebe:(whispering) Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Uh wow! Isnt it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
 Phoebe:Oh well as long as it is under control you know you cant do anything about it hes already dating her and she is a nice person that wouldnt be right.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
 Phoebe:Well maybe she didnt hear! Ok Im gonna go into that dressing room you stay in here and Ill talk and see if you can hear me.
 Phoebe:(sticks her head out) I didnt say anything yet!
 Phoebe:(goes back in) Im Rachel. Its so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
 Phoebe:(comes out too) Well some things are just hard to say to your face.
 Phoebe:Ooh! We have a problem.
 Phoebe:Good plan.
 Phoebe:Oh! Im sorry Rachel I dont have time for your childish games ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at whos more over who! (at which she walks away)
 Phoebe:Are you sure? Because Im really dreading going to this party.
 Phoebe:Mike knows Im coming and if I dont show up hell think its because of him! And I dont want to lose face! Thats a very serious thing in my culture.
 Phoebe:You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made ok because I just dont want to go back to the Emergency Room.
 Phoebe:David?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! (they hug)
 Phoebe:Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
 Phoebe:What happened?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Well its great that youre back! How are you?
 Phoebe:Good!
 Phoebe:(disappointed) Oh good for you.
 Phoebe:Mike and I broke up.
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok so were both living in New York not seeing anyone. Thats so not like us!
 Phoebe:Well... (pause) no.
 Phoebe:Id love to.
 Phoebe:Ok. (they walk away together)
 Phoebe:Oh got it stay upwind of me.
 Phoebe:I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
 Phoebe:No no because you know hes been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight hell die.
 Phoebe:Oh I should go too. Oh now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
 Phoebe:Mike?? Whos Mike?
 Phoebe:Thats right! Oh yeah... Well Ive totally forgotten about im! AH! Thats-Thats... a blast from the past!
 Phoebe:Really it doesnt mean anything. I mean you know Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
 Phoebe:Im sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! Im crazy about David and were having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? Thats-thats gonna go away right?
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:You just did it again. Chandler your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!

 Phoebe:Not Joey.
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Are you leaving The Supremes? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)
 Phoebe:Wow? Really? Thats fantastic!
 Phoebe:Oh ok you want me to marry Mike? Alright well lets just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it Mike do you take Phoebe... (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout No! No!) You know its every girls dream!
 Phoebe:Sure! Look ok bottom line I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Dont look at me that way Roseanne Rosannadanna!
 Phoebe:Sure ok yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh my God Mike!
 Phoebe:No Mikes here.
 Phoebe:What are you what are you doing here?
 Phoebe:(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!
 Phoebe:I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere you know that we had a future.
 Phoebe:David Im so sorry Im sorry.
 Phoebe:Yeah I might have said yes but that would have been wrong.
 Phoebe:Yes! (they hug)
 Phoebe:Well on the bright side now you wont have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!
 Phoebe:... and...?
 Phoebe:All right all right... Ill play if we dont keep score!
 Phoebe:Nobody wins!
 Phoebe:Yeah Im out.

 Phoebe:Cmon Mike you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!

 Phoebe:Thats the door. Hes gone...
 Phoebe:Oh were just... were sad to go so were just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)
 Phoebe:Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.

 Phoebe:You know what were gonna have sex. Lets just leave it there.
 Phoebe:Hi Mikes place.
 Phoebe:Ooh that was fast.
 Phoebe:Yeah you cant do that! Oh come on Mike strap on a pair.Why dont you just tell her that we got back together. You know women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
 Phoebe:Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
 Phoebe:Okay oh and you know if she gets upset just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)
 Phoebe:(stunned) I... Im Phoebe.
 Phoebe:Enchanté (she holds out her hand and they shake hands)
 Phoebe:Okay bye. Alright so Mikes on his way over. See you thought you guys were meeting here and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant so you know... Doesnt really matter whos right or wrong. Point is... Im gonna take off.
 Phoebe:Alright... Susie can I call you Susie?
 Phoebe:Yeah I cant say that. uhm... Susie Im gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And hes very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
 Phoebe:Well I dont...
 Phoebe:Nothing theres nothing wrong with you.
 Phoebe:Damn it woman pull yourself together! Have some pride for the love of God.
 Phoebe:Okay not a fan of the tough love.
 Phoebe:But he didnt really know you know. He wasnt planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
 Phoebe:Look Precious... Mikes not worth this. Youre an attractive intelligent woman and lets face it Mikes kind of a wang. I mean he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And I dont like to kiss-and-tell but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

 Phoebe:You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) Oh so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile! If-if you dont wanna get me on my mo-Bile dont call me on my mo-Bile!
 Phoebe:Oh I know! Oh...I slept with Billy Joel. All right who hasnt?
 Phoebe:Ugh Lets just cut her out!
 Phoebe:Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her till she gets the point!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
 Phoebe:Oh you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
 Phoebe:Ok don’t hold thy breath!
 Phoebe:Why why why didn’t you just say no!
 Phoebe:(leaving) Fine fine! You would not hold up well under torture!

 Phoebe:Well...kinda.
 Phoebe:Yeah well in America youre just an ass.
 Phoebe:(Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
 Phoebe:Oh Chandler! Thank God youre alive. Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
 Phoebe:Please Monica? In the hall?
 Phoebe:It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
 Phoebe:Youre also so generous and kind and scrappy!
 Phoebe:Exactly! Look no matter what I tried to do I couldnt keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
 Phoebe:Yeah you are. And Im so glad that you fought your way back in because I dont know what I would do without you.
 Phoebe:Yeah I guess youre right.
 Phoebe:Oooh I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids on our birthday our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
 Phoebe:Oh COOL!! Wow its like a time capsule!
 Phoebe:Oh just think... shes gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasnt even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And theyll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
 Phoebe:Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
 Phoebe:Joey its a birthday party.
 Phoebe:So you’re gonna... hit on her?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
 Phoebe:Separate performances.
 Phoebe:Sure yeah!
 Phoebe:(to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
 Phoebe:That’s right Ive prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
 Phoebe:No of course not! I also you know prepared a reading (she picks up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.
 Phoebe:And you know I have a massage client soon.
 Phoebe:Well if youre leaving Im definitely gonna go.
 Phoebe:Oh no! Hes not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)
 Phoebe:No it did not.
 Phoebe:Joey? How could you just let them leave?
 Phoebe:Wh.. what? No wait you dont get to leave! Ive got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
 Phoebe:Well oh ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok and as the person who realized that I get to go!
 Phoebe:No lets just draw straws.
 Phoebe:(Visibly excited) Yeah!! Lets do that!
 Phoebe:Ok! I want the dolphin!
 Phoebe:Im too excited!
 Phoebe:Go! Go!
 Phoebe:Good job Alan!
 Phoebe:Yeah see you later!
 Phoebe:Hey are Ross and Rachel back?
 Phoebe:Oh good I didnt miss the party.
 Phoebe:I just felt so bad missing this. So I just slipped him a little something you know. As long as Im back in five or six hours it will be alright.
 Phoebe:(pointing at cake) Hey you made it into a bunny.
 Phoebe:(yelling at the top of her voice) Go go go Alan! Run you hairy bastard!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yes I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
 Phoebe:YEAH!
 Phoebe:Uh-uh. Ehm a Knicks game.
 Phoebe:Hey you know what Ive never had a one-year anniversary before so no matter where we go Im wearing something fancy pants and... Im gonna put on my finest jewelry and were gonna have sex in a public rest room.
 Phoebe:Excuse me anniversary. Excuse me anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm sir could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. Its my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe its been a whole year!
 Phoebe:ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
 Phoebe:YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOURE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
 Phoebe:Oh how lame... oh it’s so tacky and impersonal.
 Phoebe:Oh it’s the worst way to propose!
 Phoebe:Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
 Phoebe:Well mine was worse than that.
 Phoebe:We were at the game and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
 Phoebe:Well that’s what I said but it turns out Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
 Phoebe:Yeah I really do! Yes but after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean I said no in Barbados and now this!
 Phoebe:Oh I dont know I dont know isnt that a little desperate?
 Phoebe:(To Rachel and Ross) Well do you think I should propose?
 Phoebe:Ok ok so how should I do it?
 Phoebe:Yeah that does make sense. Ok now would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?
 Phoebe:No Ive got work and then Im proposing..
 Phoebe:Uhuh uhuh... (seems distracted)
 Phoebe:Im not. Im praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?
 Phoebe:Well I think you should wait.
 Phoebe:Well if you dont... if you dont hold it in you dont get all the nutrients.
 Phoebe:Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
 Phoebe:Thats not very enlightened!
 Phoebe:Hey hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!
 Phoebe:That woman at the game didnt know what she was talking about. Mike obviously you have balls.
 Phoebe:(the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose I promise Ill say yes. Whether... whether you know it is in a basketball game or in sky writing or you know like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
 Phoebe:Its in the cake isnt it?
 Phoebe:Whats the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? Im sorry Im sorry!
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb and takes all of these off.)
 Phoebe:Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)
 Phoebe:Yes!
 Phoebe:I love you more!
 Phoebe:(she enters) Hey...
 Phoebe:Oh Im just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!
 Phoebe:Well it was really sweet and like the most romantic thing ever.
 Phoebe:Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh and I have something for you!
 Phoebe:Its yes my little black book. Its got the numbers of all the guys Ive dated.
 Phoebe:I would but youre the last one.
 Phoebe:Oh my first love!
 Phoebe:Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh its OK no he was old yeah! And he lived a full life he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
 Phoebe:(proud of herself) Oh yes they are.
 Phoebe:(looking at Monica entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Well I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh its so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
 Phoebe:A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
 Phoebe:Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh I know!! Oh you should take her!
 Phoebe:Why you dont like her?
 Phoebe:Really? You think?
 Phoebe:Ok Ill fight for her. Ok! Oh wait oh I just realized... if I do that that means you dont get her.
 Phoebe:Hi! Sorry Im late.
 Phoebe:No he really hates it. But hes gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is Gladys is yours!
 Phoebe:Oh shes that work of art I made you know with the woman coming out of the frame.
 Phoebe:Oh I didnt know you wanted her too!
 Phoebe:Girls girls stop ok? Well flip a coin. Heads shes Rachels tails shes Monicas. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica shes yours!
 Phoebe:(smiling from ear to ear) Well Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the painting)
 Phoebe:(genuinely excited about it) Yeah yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
 Phoebe:Really? It doesnt have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
 Phoebe:Hey! (theres a pause)
 Phoebe:You guys! You guys! You dont have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesnt get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
 Phoebe:I knew it!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Its really crazy! The hall the dress the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
 Phoebe:So what did you two do about it?
 Phoebe:But really it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
 Phoebe:Yeah! Now how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
 Phoebe:Yes. Were here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
 Phoebe:Well I think youre gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)
 Phoebe:And we dont want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
 Phoebe:Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
 Phoebe:Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
 Phoebe:Sure I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
 Phoebe:Oh look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)
 Phoebe:Mhm... its moist.
 Phoebe:Hello is this the creepy residence?
 Phoebe:Awe this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
 Phoebe:No no no we’re not having a big reception we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
 Phoebe:We you know we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you but oh please I put this on? (she puts it on) And ow I look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster) why well radiant. (pause) All right well who cares I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
 Phoebe:City Hall.
 Phoebe:It’s ok it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
 Phoebe:Well I’ll just ask for it back!
 Phoebe:It’s for our wedding day! Right now is this guy gay or straight because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
 Phoebe:The donation we made earlier we k… we w… we want it back.
 Phoebe:Yeah. See that money was for a big wedding that we thought we didn’t want but it turns out we do.
 Phoebe:I am sorry. I am but this wedding is just really important to me.
 Phoebe:Hey that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)
 Phoebe:(Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
 Phoebe:Yeah I really do. You know I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few 
 Phoebe:Look I cant have a wedding with this money now. Its tainted.
 Phoebe:And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time my friend hasnt shot 
 Phoebe:(to the Charity guy) Were back!
 Phoebe:Yeah because you know what its... its all about the children.
 Phoebe:Although... its also about the wedding... Ugh alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
 Phoebe:But... but... but were giving you this!
 Phoebe:(looks at the amount on the check and gasps) Well this is very generous!
 Phoebe:Oh is that you?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well personally I think its great youre giving yourself a break.
 Phoebe:Sure. Its just as well... I mean last year wasnt very good. I think shes losing her touch.
 Phoebe:Am I? Really? Am I? Well why dont you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well think about it think about it youll be trying to top than you did last year. Youd be in competition... with yourself.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah happy needless-turkey-murder day.
 Phoebe:Youre not making the pies yourself?
 Phoebe:Hey Rach.
 Phoebe:Whats Emma doing today?
 Phoebe:Well I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
 Phoebe:Okay but well before you say no my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma shes a real dog!
 Phoebe:(sarcastic) Oh... okay.
 Phoebe:Okay oh and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
 Phoebe:Well I was thinking...
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:We cant leave now! There was this one baby Haley who was favourite to win and she got croup so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open folks!
 Phoebe:Oh I know we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) Its okay. Now the way I see it our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
 Phoebe:(panicking) But Emmas got what it takes she could go all the way!
 Phoebe:Okay. Rachel the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Good! Oh yay! Lets get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
 Phoebe:Well shes gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
 Phoebe:Why not!
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:No were late!
 Phoebe:Dont point that thing at me Tribbiani!
 Phoebe:Uh we were at the Spelling Bee!
 Phoebe:And it looks like she put makeup on her!
 Phoebe:You guys there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
 Phoebe:Alright what are we gonna say?
 Phoebe:Oh good thats good but you dont look like you were mugged!
 Phoebe:Were just... were trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this We can say that Monica told us 5 oclock not 4 oclock. That way were right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
 Phoebe:Well Im not going in first. I bet that vein on Monicas forehead is popping like crazy.
 Phoebe:Oh really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his fire and mimics a bursting water balloon thus putting the fire out).
 Phoebe:Its locked.
 Phoebe:What are we gonna do? Im starving.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah!
 Phoebe:Well I dont know if thats such a good idea. They clearly dont want to be with us.
 Phoebe:So bad.
 Phoebe:Pies oh we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emmas trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).
 Phoebe:Come on you guys lets just do our own Thanksgiving.
 Phoebe:Ill pull you through.

 Phoebe:Oh right! Your adoption interview!
 Phoebe:What are you gonna name the baby?
 Phoebe:Hey!

 Phoebe:What are you talking about? Sarahs great!
 Phoebe:That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So she took some fries big deal!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
 Phoebe:(to Rachel) Oh
 Phoebe:Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
 Phoebe:Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
 Phoebe:What? You know about the plate thing?
 Phoebe:(to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
 Phoebe:Well I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
 Phoebe:(to Ross) This place is awesome!
 Phoebe:Wow!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:What? They will be!
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah but I am not sure about some of the bras I got.
 Phoebe:Oh! okay. Wait are we in Joeys imagination?
 Phoebe:oh well Ross probably has it you can get it from him later.
 Phoebe:Wait does he eat chalk?
 Phoebe:Just cause I dont want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
 Phoebe:Fine!  Be murky!
 Phoebe: If I let go of my hair my head will fall off.
 Phoebe:(sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...
 Phoebe:(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
 Phoebe:What does that mean?   Does he sell it drink it or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesnt know.)
 Phoebe:Ooh I just pulled out four eyelashes. That cant be good.
 Phoebe:Oh I wish I could but I dont want to.
 Phoebe:(singing) Love is sweet as summer showers love is a wondrous work of art but your love oh your love your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
 Phoebe:Oh no dont hate you dont want to put that out into the universe.
 Phoebe:All right cmere gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
 Phoebe:Give her a break its hard being on your own for the first time.
 Phoebe:Youre welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison and I got here and I didnt know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was like cleaning windshields outside port authority and then he killed himself and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me I know exactly how you feel.
 Phoebe:(sings) I cant believe what Im hearing here...
 Phoebe:(sings) What I said you had...

 Phoebe:Oh yeah? Well lets see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)
 Phoebe:Oh hi Chandler. Its Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
 Phoebe:(shocked) Oh well its a shame that you-that you miss the movie cause we were gonna see you know either Liar Liar or Betrayal or... An Affair To Remember.
 Phoebe:Ok then maybe itll be uhm...

 Phoebe:Well look whatever happens we’re here for you and we love you.
 Phoebe:They went in together. So sorry.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Why do you have a realtor?
 Phoebe:So youre gonna move?
 Phoebe:Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You cant move out of the city what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
 Phoebe:Wha..? Again with the nature what are you? Beavers?
 Phoebe:Yeah but so is this.

 Phoebe:Écoutez je vais vous dire la vérité. Cest mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. (Translation Listen I will tell you the truth. Hes my little bother. Hes a bit retarded.)

 Phoebe:I need to change my name please. See I need to change it because Im-Im hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) Youre fun.
 Phoebe:Okay well I just dont I dont know how it works exactly. See my name is Buffay and my husbands name is Hannigan so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?

 Phoebe:Well we cannot tell Joey about this. Hes already flipping out about everything thats changing. This will push him over the edge.
 Phoebe:Well not for a little while. Lets just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
 Phoebe:Hey. Everything ok?
 Phoebe:Estelle? Why?
 Phoebe:I’m guessing she does.
 Phoebe:Well no no wait wait wait. All right I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.
 Phoebe:Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)
 Phoebe:Man tough week for Estelle!
 Phoebe:Hey Joey want come with me to… are you ok?
 Phoebe:No that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
 Phoebe:No no no! Dont call her! You wait for her to call you (Joey considers it)
 Phoebe:Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
 Phoebe:(picking up her bag) All right so promise youre gonna wait for her to call you?
 Phoebe:(on the other side of the line still pretending to be Estelle) Joey its Estelle. (Joeys eyes bulge up he looks afraid)
 Phoebe:Yeah I wanted to call and tell you that theres no hard feelings for firing me.
 Phoebe:Well I didnt think I should just drop by...
 Phoebe:Anyway you did what you had to do. Im okay.

 Phoebe:These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these theyll snap like a piece of licorice.
 Phoebe:Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles Chandler looks aghast)
 Phoebe:I dont know. But God Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
 Phoebe:You know maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
 Phoebe:Ross if youre this upset you should go and talk to her.
 Phoebe:Tell me about it.
 Phoebe:All right I think Im gonna head out.
 Phoebe:I thought I was going home to go to bed but Im sensing theres something less fun for me to do here.

 Phoebe:Damn it woman pull yourself together! Have some pride for the love of God.
 Phoebe:Okay not a fan of the tough love.
 Phoebe:But he didnt really know you know. He wasnt planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
 Phoebe:Look Precious... Mikes not worth this. Youre an attractive intelligent woman and lets face it Mikes kind of a wang. I mean he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And I dont like to kiss-and-tell but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

 Phoebe:Ok don’t hold thy breath!
 Phoebe:Why why why didn’t you just say no!
 Phoebe:(leaving) Fine fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
 Phoebe:I did!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Oh! Well what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
 Phoebe:(makes a face) Are you kidding I love it!
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Musty!
 Phoebe:Well...kinda.
 Phoebe:Yeah well in America youre just an ass.
 Phoebe:(Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
 Phoebe:Oh Chandler! Thank God youre alive. Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
 Phoebe:Please Monica? In the hall?
 Phoebe:It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
 Phoebe:Youre also so generous and kind and scrappy!
 Phoebe:Exactly! Look no matter what I tried to do I couldnt keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
 Phoebe:Yeah you are. And Im so glad that you fought your way back in because I dont know what I would do without you.
 Phoebe:Yeah I guess youre right.
 Phoebe:Oooh I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids on our birthday our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
 Phoebe:Oh COOL!! Wow its like a time capsule!
 Phoebe:Oh just think... shes gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasnt even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And theyll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
 Phoebe:Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
 Phoebe:Joey its a birthday party.
 Phoebe:So you’re gonna... hit on her?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
 Phoebe:Separate performances.
 Phoebe:Sure yeah!
 Phoebe:(to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
 Phoebe:That’s right Ive prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
 Phoebe:No of course not! I also you know prepared a reading (she picks up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.
 Phoebe:And you know I have a massage client soon.
 Phoebe:Well if youre leaving Im definitely gonna go.
 Phoebe:Oh no! Hes not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)
 Phoebe:No it did not.
 Phoebe:Joey? How could you just let them leave?
 Phoebe:Wh.. what? No wait you dont get to leave! Ive got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
 Phoebe:Well oh ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok and as the person who realized that I get to go!
 Phoebe:No lets just draw straws.
 Phoebe:(Visibly excited) Yeah!! Lets do that!
 Phoebe:Ok! I want the dolphin!
 Phoebe:Im too excited!
 Phoebe:Go! Go!
 Phoebe:Good job Alan!
 Phoebe:Yeah see you later!
 Phoebe:Hey are Ross and Rachel back?
 Phoebe:Oh good I didnt miss the party.
 Phoebe:I just felt so bad missing this. So I just slipped him a little something you know. As long as Im back in five or six hours it will be alright.
 Phoebe:(pointing at cake) Hey you made it into a bunny.
 Phoebe:(yelling at the top of her voice) Go go go Alan! Run you hairy bastard!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yes I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
 Phoebe:YEAH!
 Phoebe:Uh-uh. Ehm a Knicks game.
 Phoebe:Hey you know what Ive never had a one-year anniversary before so no matter where we go Im wearing something fancy pants and... Im gonna put on my finest jewelry and were gonna have sex in a public rest room.
 Phoebe:Excuse me anniversary. Excuse me anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm sir could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. Its my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe its been a whole year!
 Phoebe:ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
 Phoebe:YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOURE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
 Phoebe:Oh how lame... oh it’s so tacky and impersonal.
 Phoebe:Oh it’s the worst way to propose!
 Phoebe:Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
 Phoebe:Well mine was worse than that.
 Phoebe:We were at the game and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
 Phoebe:Well that’s what I said but it turns out Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
 Phoebe:Yeah I really do! Yes but after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean I said no in Barbados and now this!
 Phoebe:Oh I dont know I dont know isnt that a little desperate?
 Phoebe:(To Rachel and Ross) Well do you think I should propose?
 Phoebe:Ok ok so how should I do it?
 Phoebe:Yeah that does make sense. Ok now would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?
 Phoebe:No Ive got work and then Im proposing..
 Phoebe:Uhuh uhuh... (seems distracted)
 Phoebe:Im not. Im praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?
 Phoebe:Well I think you should wait.
 Phoebe:Well if you dont... if you dont hold it in you dont get all the nutrients.
 Phoebe:Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
 Phoebe:Thats not very enlightened!
 Phoebe:Hey hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!
 Phoebe:That woman at the game didnt know what she was talking about. Mike obviously you have balls.
 Phoebe:(the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose I promise Ill say yes. Whether... whether you know it is in a basketball game or in sky writing or you know like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
 Phoebe:Its in the cake isnt it?
 Phoebe:Whats the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? Im sorry Im sorry!
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb and takes all of these off.)
 Phoebe:Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)
 Phoebe:Yes!
 Phoebe:I love you more!
 Phoebe:(she enters) Hey...
 Phoebe:Oh Im just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!
 Phoebe:Well it was really sweet and like the most romantic thing ever.
 Phoebe:Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh and I have something for you!
 Phoebe:Its yes my little black book. Its got the numbers of all the guys Ive dated.
 Phoebe:I would but youre the last one.
 Phoebe:Oh my first love!
 Phoebe:Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh its OK no he was old yeah! And he lived a full life he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
 Phoebe:(proud of herself) Oh yes they are.
 Phoebe:(looking at Monica entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Well I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh its so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
 Phoebe:A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
 Phoebe:Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh I know!! Oh you should take her!
 Phoebe:Why you dont like her?
 Phoebe:Really? You think?
 Phoebe:Ok Ill fight for her. Ok! Oh wait oh I just realized... if I do that that means you dont get her.
 Phoebe:Hi! Sorry Im late.
 Phoebe:No he really hates it. But hes gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is Gladys is yours!
 Phoebe:Oh shes that work of art I made you know with the woman coming out of the frame.
 Phoebe:Oh I didnt know you wanted her too!
 Phoebe:Girls girls stop ok? Well flip a coin. Heads shes Rachels tails shes Monicas. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica shes yours!
 Phoebe:(smiling from ear to ear) Well Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the painting)
 Phoebe:(genuinely excited about it) Yeah yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
 Phoebe:Really? It doesnt have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
 Phoebe:Hey! (theres a pause)
 Phoebe:You guys! You guys! You dont have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesnt get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
 Phoebe:I knew it!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Its really crazy! The hall the dress the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
 Phoebe:So what did you two do about it?
 Phoebe:But really it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
 Phoebe:Yeah! Now how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
 Phoebe:Yes. Were here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
 Phoebe:Well I think youre gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)
 Phoebe:And we dont want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
 Phoebe:Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
 Phoebe:Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
 Phoebe:Sure I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
 Phoebe:Oh look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)
 Phoebe:Mhm... its moist.
 Phoebe:Hello is this the creepy residence?
 Phoebe:Awe this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
 Phoebe:No no no we’re not having a big reception we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
 Phoebe:We you know we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you but oh please I put this on? (she puts it on) And ow I look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster) why well radiant. (pause) All right well who cares I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
 Phoebe:City Hall.
 Phoebe:It’s ok it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
 Phoebe:Well I’ll just ask for it back!
 Phoebe:It’s for our wedding day! Right now is this guy gay or straight because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
 Phoebe:The donation we made earlier we k… we w… we want it back.
 Phoebe:Yeah. See that money was for a big wedding that we thought we didn’t want but it turns out we do.
 Phoebe:I am sorry. I am but this wedding is just really important to me.
 Phoebe:Hey that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)
 Phoebe:(Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
 Phoebe:Yeah I really do. You know I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few 
 Phoebe:Look I cant have a wedding with this money now. Its tainted.
 Phoebe:And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time my friend hasnt shot 
 Phoebe:(to the Charity guy) Were back!
 Phoebe:Yeah because you know what its... its all about the children.
 Phoebe:Although... its also about the wedding... Ugh alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
 Phoebe:But... but... but were giving you this!
 Phoebe:(looks at the amount on the check and gasps) Well this is very generous!
 Phoebe:Oh is that you?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well personally I think its great youre giving yourself a break.
 Phoebe:Sure. Its just as well... I mean last year wasnt very good. I think shes losing her touch.
 Phoebe:Am I? Really? Am I? Well why dont you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well think about it think about it youll be trying to top than you did last year. Youd be in competition... with yourself.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah happy needless-turkey-murder day.
 Phoebe:Youre not making the pies yourself?
 Phoebe:Hey Rach.
 Phoebe:Whats Emma doing today?
 Phoebe:Well I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
 Phoebe:Okay but well before you say no my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma shes a real dog!
 Phoebe:(sarcastic) Oh... okay.
 Phoebe:Okay oh and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
 Phoebe:Well I was thinking...
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:We cant leave now! There was this one baby Haley who was favourite to win and she got croup so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open folks!
 Phoebe:Oh I know we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) Its okay. Now the way I see it our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
 Phoebe:(panicking) But Emmas got what it takes she could go all the way!
 Phoebe:Okay. Rachel the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Good! Oh yay! Lets get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
 Phoebe:Well shes gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
 Phoebe:Why not!
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:No were late!
 Phoebe:Dont point that thing at me Tribbiani!
 Phoebe:Uh we were at the Spelling Bee!
 Phoebe:And it looks like she put makeup on her!
 Phoebe:You guys there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
 Phoebe:Alright what are we gonna say?
 Phoebe:Oh good thats good but you dont look like you were mugged!
 Phoebe:Were just... were trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this We can say that Monica told us 5 oclock not 4 oclock. That way were right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
 Phoebe:Well Im not going in first. I bet that vein on Monicas forehead is popping like crazy.
 Phoebe:Oh really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his fire and mimics a bursting water balloon thus putting the fire out).
 Phoebe:Its locked.
 Phoebe:What are we gonna do? Im starving.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah!
 Phoebe:Well I dont know if thats such a good idea. They clearly dont want to be with us.
 Phoebe:So bad.
 Phoebe:Pies oh we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emmas trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).
 Phoebe:Come on you guys lets just do our own Thanksgiving.
 Phoebe:Ill pull you through.
 Phoebe:Ive already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
 Phoebe:Just a sec. were kind in the middle of something here.
 Phoebe:I know. Have you considered pageanting?
 Phoebe:Oh right! Your adoption interview!
 Phoebe:What are you gonna name the baby?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh thats Sarah. No no. Dont you get any ideas ok? No Im not setting you up with any more of my friends!

 Phoebe:Yeah! So youre gonna call this one back?
 Phoebe:What are you talking about? Sarahs great!
 Phoebe:That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So she took some fries big deal!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
 Phoebe:(to Rachel) Oh
 Phoebe:Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
 Phoebe:Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
 Phoebe:What? You know about the plate thing?
 Phoebe:(to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
 Phoebe:Well I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
 Phoebe:(to Ross) This place is awesome!
 Phoebe:Wow!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:What? They will be!
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah but I am not sure about some of the bras I got.
 Phoebe:Oh! okay. Wait are we in Joeys imagination?
 Phoebe:oh well Ross probably has it you can get it from him later.
 Phoebe:Wait does he eat chalk?
 Phoebe:Just cause I dont want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
 Phoebe:Fine!  Be murky!
 Phoebe: If I let go of my hair my head will fall off.
 Phoebe:(sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...
 Phoebe:(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
 Phoebe:What does that mean?   Does he sell it drink it or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesnt know.)
 Phoebe:Ooh I just pulled out four eyelashes. That cant be good.
 Phoebe:Oh I wish I could but I dont want to.
 Phoebe:(singing) Love is sweet as summer showers love is a wondrous work of art but your love oh your love your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
 Phoebe:Oh no dont hate you dont want to put that out into the universe.
 Phoebe:All right cmere gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
 Phoebe:Give her a break its hard being on your own for the first time.
 Phoebe:Youre welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison and I got here and I didnt know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was like cleaning windshields outside port authority and then he killed himself and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me I know exactly how you feel.
 Phoebe:(sings) I cant believe what Im hearing here...
 Phoebe:(sings) What I said you had...
 Phoebe:Oh was I doing it again?
 Phoebe:If you had to what would you give up food or sex?
 Phoebe:Ross how about you. What would you give up sex or food?

 Phoebe:Oh yeah? Well lets see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)
 Phoebe:Oh hi Chandler. Its Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
 Phoebe:(shocked) Oh well its a shame that you-that you miss the movie cause we were gonna see you know either Liar Liar or Betrayal or... An Affair To Remember.
 Phoebe:Ok then maybe itll be uhm...

 Phoebe:Well look whatever happens we’re here for you and we love you.
 Phoebe:They went in together. So sorry.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Why do you have a realtor?
 Phoebe:So youre gonna move?
 Phoebe:Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You cant move out of the city what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
 Phoebe:Wha..? Again with the nature what are you? Beavers?
 Phoebe:Yeah but so is this.
 Phoebe:You guys you know what I just realized? Joker is poker with a J. Coincidence?
 Phoebe:[looking outside the window] Eww look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.

 Phoebe:What else?
 Phoebe:That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
 Phoebe:Yeah you dont wanna live in Westchester. Thats like the worst of the Chesters.

 Phoebe:Well not for a little while. Lets just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
 Phoebe:Hey. Everything ok?
 Phoebe:Estelle? Why?
 Phoebe:I’m guessing she does.
 Phoebe:Well no no wait wait wait. All right I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.
 Phoebe:Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)
 Phoebe:Man tough week for Estelle!
 Phoebe:Hey Joey want come with me to… are you ok?
 Phoebe:No that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
 Phoebe:No no no! Dont call her! You wait for her to call you (Joey considers it)
 Phoebe:Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
 Phoebe:(picking up her bag) All right so promise youre gonna wait for her to call you?
 Phoebe:(on the other side of the line still pretending to be Estelle) Joey its Estelle. (Joeys eyes bulge up he looks afraid)

 Phoebe:These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these theyll snap like a piece of licorice.
 Phoebe:Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles Chandler looks aghast)
 Phoebe:I dont know. But God Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
 Phoebe:You know maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
 Phoebe:Ross if youre this upset you should go and talk to her.
 Phoebe:Tell me about it.
 Phoebe:All right I think Im gonna head out.
 Phoebe:I thought I was going home to go to bed but Im sensing theres something less fun for me to do here.

 Phoebe:This is so great.
 Phoebe:I mean well cause when I was growing up you know my dad left and my mother died and my stepfather went to jail so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.

 Phoebe:Here look alright does this help?
 Phoebe:Yeah but yknow its... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
 Phoebe:No I mean I mean when youre at the fifteenth date yknow youre already in a very relationshippy place. Yknow its... youre committed.
 Phoebe:Well I mean then what happens if it doesnt work out?
 Phoebe:Maybe theres someone else.
 Phoebe:Ok so this is pretty much whats happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since you know forever but every time he tried to tell her something kind of got in the way like cats and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like forget about her but when Ross was in China on his dig Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like Oh my god. So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back but what she didnt know was that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So thats pretty much everything you need to know. But enough about us. So howve you been?
 Phoebe:Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like all right whats bigger than huge?
 Phoebe:Yes.
 Phoebe:Cause you know (in that voice) if you dont look good we dont look good. I love that voice.
 Phoebe:Oh ok. How its been so long since youve had sex youre wondering if theyve changed it?
 Phoebe:All right so what were you thinking?
 Phoebe:Ohh! No.

 Phoebe:I know Im not but you are and I was trying to spare your feelings.
 Phoebe:Im still on no.

 Phoebe:Where?
 Phoebe:(to Paulo) Ok youre gonna have to not touch my ass.
 Phoebe:All right. Ok but but!  You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
 Phoebe:All right. (Talking to Monicas hair.) Now some of you are gonna get cut and some of you arent. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
 Phoebe:All right thats it I quit.
 Phoebe:Yeah but this (makes Monicas face) isnt the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok this (makes Monicas face) is the face of a person who you know doesnt trust a person.

 Phoebe:I cant I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
 Phoebe:Monica she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
 Phoebe:Woof woof.

 Phoebe:Duh I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her wrist and tastes it.)
 Phoebe:I licked my arm what?
 Phoebe:So?
 Phoebe:You wont even taste it?
 Phoebe:Not even if you just pretend that its milk?
 Phoebe:Oh I tasted Bens milk and Ross freaked out.
 Phoebe:Come on. It doesnt taste bad.

 Phoebe:Hi Monica!
 Phoebe:Oh my God has she slept at all?
 Phoebe:Oh okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning but all I could hear was like this high squeaky sound so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
 Phoebe:Ooh. Oh. It looks like like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (Ross gives her this look like Yeah doesnt it and gets up to dump it down the drain.)
 Phoebe:Maybe because you told him not to.
 Phoebe:Yeah oh Princess Leia and the gold bikini every guy our age loved that.
 Phoebe:Um um. Its huge. Yeah thats the moment when-when you know she stopped being a princess and became like a woman you know.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah um-mm. Oh!

 Phoebe:Well okay fine use my happy place. Okay Im just gonna I have to ask that you dont move anything.
 Phoebe:Okay all right so your in a meadow millions of stars in the sky....
 Phoebe:All right there are no questions in the happy place. Okay just the warm breeze and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
 Phoebe:All right betting and wagering of any kind are Im sure not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just you know the-the lovely waterfalls and the the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....

 Phoebe:It’s Monica’s bed. What?
 Phoebe:So. This has always been Monica’s bed what you’re just noticing now how self-involved are you?
 Phoebe:Well if you really really want it then it’s okay.
 Phoebe:No no it’s just my tooth.
 Phoebe:No thanks I have a good one too. I just I I can’t see him.
 Phoebe:Because every time I go to the dentist somebody dies.
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah first there was my aunt Mary and then there was umm John my mailman and then my my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.

 Phoebe:All right fine fine but if you’re my next victim don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
 Phoebe:Although don’t feel like you can’t visit.
 Phoebe:Well you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist maybe I’ll kill him.
 Phoebe:Well I’m going to the dentist so listen okay just be on the look out for anything that that that you can fall into or or that can fall on you or... All right just look out! Okay And um I also just wanna I just wanna tell you all that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)

 Phoebe:You keep the old ones in the back that is so ageist.
 Phoebe:So what happens to the old guys?
 Phoebe:Why do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her as this haunty demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey’s shoulder as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)
 Phoebe:(running up carrying a tree) Wait wait wait wait wait! No no you don’t want that one. No you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)
 Phoebe:Okay but that’s why you have to buy it so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him Joey

 Phoebe:All right yknow what nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry I’m sorry I didn’t mean to get so emotional I guess it’s just the holidays it’s hard.
 Phoebe:Oh I wasn’t even thinking about that.
 Phoebe:This is the worst Christmas ever.
 Phoebe:Oh! Oh my God!
 Phoebe:You saved them! You guys! Oh God you’re the best!

 Phoebe:Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Except for yknow when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.

 Phoebe:God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?
 Phoebe:They have the best stuff in there.
 Phoebe:(reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one
 Phoebe:Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
 Phoebe:Was it not pain-free?
 Phoebe:Huh well the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.
 Phoebe:(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
 Phoebe:Oh!!
 Phoebe:Ow!!!
 Phoebe:We’re all right.
 Phoebe:We’re all right.
 Phoebe:For your information this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:(to Joey) What what are they talking about?
 Phoebe:Whe-where did he put it?!
 Phoebe:Oh I knew something had to be wrong because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
 Phoebe:Should we do something?
 Phoebe:Hi it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 900 with Mr. Rehack ‘cause it’s like 915 now and I’m not there.
 Phoebe:We could eat the wax! It’s organic.
 Phoebe:No not the used wax.
 Phoebe:They’re gonna get through this aren’t they?
 Phoebe:Yeah yknow people can be so self-involved.
 Phoebe:They’ve been quiet for a long time.
 Phoebe:Oh come on they can be in the same room.
 Phoebe:Why? What happened now?
 Phoebe:Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.
 Phoebe:Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God this is like 60 Minutes okay when when at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then yknow you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
 Phoebe:Yknow I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out and everyone was happy....
 Phoebe:Yeah and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.

You don’t you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
 Phoebe:Yeah otherwise I mean that’s that’s that’s just it for us hanging out together. Yknow is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you be civil?
 Phoebe:Okay. Good all right let’s get back in the car ‘cause it’s freezing and my chest is unsupported.
 Phoebe:Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
 Phoebe:Or or the rodeo!!

 Phoebe:No-no oh I’m fine with the age thing yknow until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!
 Phoebe:But I mean do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank (she walks behind them again and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it’s not fair to the babies and yknow what it’s not good home economics.
 Phoebe:Yes. Not out loud.
 Phoebe:Yeah but if I do tell him then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom I can’t. (pause) But you guys can please you gotta talk him out of it.
 Phoebe:Come on you guys you have nothing to lose I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!

 Phoebe:Well then (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!

 Phoebe:Yeah I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?

 Phoebe:Uh well I can tell you why. It’s it’s because of me. But yknow what I only did it because I love you. Okay?
 Phoebe:Umm well I I kinda had a little chat with Alice and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together yknow. And you’re gonna see it to one day you really really will.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Okay but.
 Phoebe:Hey Frank. Look okay I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.
 Phoebe:Yeah but not just that.
 Phoebe:None the less.
 Phoebe:That’s right exactly. (sees them) All right it’s a good bye kiss that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay no the important thing is that you see what I’m saying yknow just yknow this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay all right good. (leaves).
 Phoebe:We were out of Doritos.
 Phoebe:Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
 Phoebe:What so what are you gonna tell him?
 Phoebe:Huh.
 Phoebe:Wow. So okay maybe that means that you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
 Phoebe:Okay so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.
 Phoebe:So you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)
 Phoebe:Yknow what you should like you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
 Phoebe:Yeah or or or Mississ-Pete.
 Phoebe:Yeah kinda.
 Phoebe:(to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up startled) Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman Silverman...
 Phoebe:It isn’t?
 Phoebe:Oh okay. There should be Gold Man!
 Phoebe:Okay well he would turn things to gold.
 Phoebe:Ahh his work is done.
 Phoebe:Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)
 Phoebe:Oh it’s so great to see you feeling like this!
 Phoebe:Wait am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad in a way.
 Phoebe:Wow a house for dolls that is so cool! When I was kid I had a barrel.
 Phoebe:No just a barrel.
 Phoebe:Really?! Really?!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.
 Phoebe:So I’m here ready to play.
 Phoebe:I brought a bunch of stuff for the house so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)
 Phoebe:That’s a dog every house should have a dog.
 Phoebe:Well maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
 Phoebe:No no that’s the ghost for the attic.
 Phoebe:Well nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
 Phoebe:Okay obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.
 Phoebe:(holding a dinosaur) Okay dinosaur attack!! Quick everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
 Phoebe:Okay (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.
 Phoebe:The little ones do.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Look everybody look at my new dollhouse!!
 Phoebe:Look look! (She lifts up the roof and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)
 Phoebe:Oh okay it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)
 Phoebe:The Licorice Room you can eat all the furniture. And when guests come over they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
 Phoebe:Hey does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)
 Phoebe:Watch watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)
 Phoebe:And and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!
 Phoebe:All right. Did everyone get out okay?
 Phoebe:Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something and moves to remove it.)

 Phoebe:Oh my God they took my idea!
 Phoebe:Yeah! Okay here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)
 Phoebe:Oh my God are you guys okay?
 Phoebe:Umm oh about three months.
 Phoebe:Whoa-whoa-whoa you guys do you know anything about chicks?
 Phoebe:Okay well they are a huge responsibility especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food and lot’s and lot’s of love.
 Phoebe:(to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting you went to Japan made up a woman.
 Phoebe:I’m just saying this woman I mean she’s fictitious. No?
 Phoebe:‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together maybe something might happen and...
 Phoebe:Yeah no I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
 Phoebe:Absolutely oh I promise. Tell her what?
 Phoebe:No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive but my memory sucks.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Ohh Monica I am so excited for you.
 Phoebe:Ooh I have to tell you something.
 Phoebe:But I can’t tell you.
 Phoebe:Well sure in a perfect world. But no I promised I wouldn’t tell and I swore to like all my gods.

 Phoebe:Oh yeah he clipped on he said call him as soon as you get a chance he’s at Flimby’s.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.
 Phoebe:No! Rachel that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow if I don’t get through they’re not gonna fix my crappy broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!
 Phoebe:Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?
 Phoebe:Thanks!
 Phoebe:Okay. (on phone) Ooh I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here.

 Phoebe:Yeah I know. Oh good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?
 Phoebe:No no no oh no-no-no it’s has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers every one. (Finds the number) Yeah every big Utah-based company has one.
 Phoebe:Sorry I’m so sorry I will pay you back.
 Phoebe:Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down breaking it) Oh-oh!
 Phoebe:Well I think I broke it. But that’s all right here’s the number you can call.

 Phoebe:Great! Okay good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)
 Phoebe:Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
 Phoebe:(to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.
 Phoebe:Yeah she was bald she’s not now.
 Phoebe:I don’t know I hardly ever say that about people.
 Phoebe:Well I’m sorry I thought you said it was okay.
 Phoebe:Well maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.
 Phoebe:Oh no Bonnie’s the best!
 Phoebe:So Ross how umm how did it go with Bonnie?
 Phoebe:Ohh that’s too bad!
 Phoebe:Yeah yknow what there are other fish in the sea.
 Phoebe:Okay I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
 Phoebe:Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant or inside his shower drain?
 Phoebe:No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!
 Phoebe:(looking in the window) Right oh yeah. Wow oh it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.
 Phoebe:Oh no! That really is nothing she is very sexually aggressive.
 Phoebe:You said it was okay!
 Phoebe:What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
 Phoebe:Okay first of all breathe. Second of all I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?
 Phoebe:Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?
 Phoebe:So?
 Phoebe:(sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.
 Phoebe:Oh we killed them all.
 Phoebe:Wait if that’s his favourite area why is he being so mean to it?
 Phoebe:(entering hurridly) Hey you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.
 Phoebe:Yknow what that means?
 Phoebe:No-no that’s not that’s not me Phoebe that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook they were like B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.
 Phoebe:I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
 Phoebe:So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.
 Phoebe:Oh I am having the best karma this week. First I find this woman who knew my parents and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
 Phoebe:Oh I wasn’t talking about his karma.
 Phoebe:And this time they’ve ganged up to form one giant super hat.

 Phoebe:I don’t know but we’re having dinner tomorrow night so I figured she’s gonna tell me then. Yknow maybe she just wanted to give him time to buy me presents I don’t know! So you’re all bored?
 Phoebe:All right I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone and you whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do and we have to do it.
 Phoebe:Okay.

 Phoebe:Noooo!!
 Phoebe:No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.
 Phoebe:(singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you thank you. Ohh and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered and to her) Except for you. You go away.

 Phoebe:Nothing. Nothing.
 Phoebe:I just I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
 Phoebe:No no-no she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily the one who killed herself.
 Phoebe:No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all okay there’s the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay and for another how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth in an “Oh my God.” gesture) Oh I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!
 Phoebe:(is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
 Phoebe:Well I’m not sure. I mean I guess until she yknow gets used to the fact that there’s yknow a new mom. Yknow I think she’s worried that yknow she’s gonna she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat in a funny voice) Well that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay I have to return a call in the other room.
 Phoebe:Well I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)

 Phoebe:Okay then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.

 Phoebe:There you go thats the spirit! Okay! Now if you need money I will lend you money but just get moving!
 Phoebe:Okay! Its worth it if it will get you moving. You havent worked in months.
 Phoebe:Yes but Im doing this.

 Phoebe:I know its tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mothers funeral was?
 Phoebe:Pay the caterer! Look Ive had a lot of jobs okay and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. Its either you know that massage wasnt long enough or I dont recognize any of those songs or you know these sombreros arent big enough. Bad little white girl!
 Phoebe:Well it seems like there werent any tears til you showed her the bill.
 Phoebe:She seems fine now.
 Phoebe:You didnt get the money did you?
 Phoebe:No! Hey were not leaving until we get paid! I dont know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey widow?
 Phoebe:Okay Widow!
 Phoebe:Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um clearly this is a very very hard time for you. Um but um we provided a service and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service and um we are not leaving here until were paid every penny. Cause you know what lady? Were part time caterers and we have no place else to go.
 Phoebe:Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)
 Phoebe:Uh... yay!
 Phoebe:Yeah. Im a hard ass.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
 Phoebe:Okay!
 Phoebe:Yeah. Oh! Itll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
 Phoebe:Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
 Phoebe:(singing) Little tiny Tarzan swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease… Darn it! Now I don’t know who to get to the next verse.
 Phoebe:Yeah ooh I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’

 Phoebe:Come on play that funky music white boy.
 Phoebe:Wow it was so—wow!
 Phoebe:What are you guys talking about I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh plus it’s just it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.
 Phoebe:(pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
 Phoebe:Oh no I’m not playing tonight.
 Phoebe:I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
 Phoebe:Oh my God he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
 Phoebe:You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)
 Phoebe:Hey! You were really great! You were really really great!

 Phoebe:Does Joey know?
 Phoebe:I think maybe yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah! No that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
 Phoebe:Oh my God he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.
 Phoebe:After that? Yeah! No I mean if I can help.
 Phoebe:Look everyone it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!
 Phoebe:Speaking of Christmas umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money umm this year maybe we could do secret Santa and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.
 Phoebe:I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
 Phoebe:Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on let’s trade!
 Phoebe:Ohh.
 Phoebe:You don’t have to do that Ross and Joey aren’t here you can watch the parade if you want.
 Phoebe:God what happened?!
 Phoebe:Open it up let me see.
 Phoebe:Ooh God it looks bad.
 Phoebe:Honey you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?

 Phoebe:Yes! She’s very excited about that.
 Phoebe:This is so cool ‘til Monica gets back it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter and then decides to add it to the dish.)
 Phoebe:Okay get out of my kitchen!
 Phoebe:All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
 Phoebe:Yeah I can see where I’d be your best shot but no. I’m sorry but I think it’s twisted.
 Phoebe:Yeah but Monica do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase That’s not how your dad used to do it.
 Phoebe:Oh I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)
 Phoebe:Oh he-he can’t talk right now.

 Phoebe:Well if you think it will help.
 Phoebe:You should! How is she?
 Phoebe:Who Josh?
 Phoebe:Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay y’know what you were right you were right. We really weren’t great at being guys but you know why? Because we’re girls.
 Phoebe:And do you know what girls are really good at?
 Phoebe:No listening! Sit! Y’know maybe it would just really really help if you would just talk.
 Phoebe:Yeah I really liked that fighter pilot one.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh! What is that? What is that?
 Phoebe:Hey—ooh so how was Vermont?

 Phoebe:Ooh hey could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.

 Phoebe:Yeah I know I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.
 Phoebe:Well why are you doing this anyway?
 Phoebe:You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny. (Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
 Phoebe:(to the player) Hi.
 Phoebe:Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.
 Phoebe:No offence but y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you y’know with the accent so…
 Phoebe:Oh poor baby.
 Phoebe:She’s right! You have to stop!
 Phoebe:Now are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?
 Phoebe:Ooh ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)
 Phoebe:See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.
 Phoebe:I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake! (Chandler shrugs and Phoebe grimaces.) No.
 Phoebe:God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh! (She goes to the bathroom.)
 Phoebe:It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat what-what smells so good?
 Phoebe:(she smells his head) No!
 Phoebe:Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!
 Phoebe:(angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat y’know? And I got nauseous.
 Phoebe:Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
 Phoebe:That’s sweat. You throw up all morning you’ll have that glow too.
 Phoebe:Ooh yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
 Phoebe:Ooh yeah! Then umm what goes on top of the salami?
 Phoebe:Oooh yeah. You’re a genius.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
 Phoebe:Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder cold blooded murder.
 Phoebe:I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
 Phoebe:Yeah totally!
 Phoebe:Yeah but at what cost? Six more months three meals a day I’m gonna eat like y’know millions of cows.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Joey I can’t believe you would do that for me.
 Phoebe:Pastrami.
 Phoebe:Hm-mm corn beef.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Six months.

 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Ohh I’m getting too pregnant for this lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)
 Phoebe:You mean like a doctor?
 Phoebe:Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh that reminds me I have to see my OB-GYN today.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Why don’t take care of this one and should I get pregnant again I’ll hold onto your card okay?

 Phoebe:Oh well okay hey y’know how when you’re umm you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row and you say Oh that’s nice?
 Phoebe:Okay yeah well good news you’re going to have three babies.
 Phoebe:Oh God I’m so glad you guys are happy I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
 Phoebe:No no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them and the added expense and…
 Phoebe:No back to happy. Back to happy!
 Phoebe:No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?
 Phoebe:You can’t give up on your dream.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Well Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay insider trading what information is there that you can give me.
 Phoebe:(entering carrying a case) Ooh good you’re hear! Okay.
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Oh this well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now I know what you’re thinking…
 Phoebe:No!
 Phoebe:No!
 Phoebe:No-no I know that but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
 Phoebe:My Saturn dealership.
 Phoebe:Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!
 Phoebe:I’m telling it! I’m telling it!
 Phoebe:Okay. You know how people need transportation but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two okay I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van bolt the table in the back and you know what I’ve got?
 Phoebe:No! Think about it it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax it’s…
 Phoebe:The name was my favourite part!
 Phoebe:YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.
 Phoebe:Hey tell him about Relaxi-Taxi and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.
 Phoebe:Oh that is better.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:(not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
 Phoebe:Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat smelly cat what are they feeding you?
 Phoebe:I know! I know and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!
 Phoebe:Hey! What are you doing here?
 Phoebe:Oh well don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
 Phoebe:Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a book) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like y’know strong and confident y’know? Like-like Exxon.
 Phoebe:No I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk but I like the idea of a name starting with The.
 Phoebe:Well I I like the idea of naming him after someone I love and Joey and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But all right I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.
 Phoebe:God Susan is so fun!
 Phoebe:Yeah I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.
 Phoebe:No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
 Phoebe:Well it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk y’know…
 Phoebe:So I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
 Phoebe:Well how about a compromise then okay? What if it’s like y’know Chanoey?
 Phoebe:All right so what are we supposed to call you?
 Phoebe:Umm Gene.
 Phoebe:Bye Gene.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wow Carol really messed you up!
 Phoebe:Yeah she turned you into this-this-this untrusting crazy jealous sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right so I don’t know what sycophant means but the rest is right.
 Phoebe:All right all right so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting then ’94 hit Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
 Phoebe:Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.
 Phoebe:Drum roll.
 Phoebe:You’re actually going through with this?
 Phoebe:You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes (To Joey) I’m I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey but eh so I’m-I’m I’m gonna I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.
 Phoebe:Yeah but you have to keep the name too!
 Phoebe:Okay!
 Phoebe:Yeah!

 Phoebe:Ooh uh… (She grabs her coat and runs out.)
 Phoebe:Okay bye!

 Phoebe:Excuse me.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah! You like ‘em? I just I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who’s been naughty and who’s been nice.) See these names are good and these names are bad. (Finally she figures it out.) Ohh.
 Phoebe:I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.
 Phoebe:Boy! I didn’t see that coming!
 Phoebe:That’s too hard. Too hard!
 Phoebe:Hey so? Are you gonna do it?
 Phoebe:Or you could end up with everything.

 Phoebe:What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)
 Phoebe:I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.) Ah-ha!
 Phoebe:(opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay it was my idea but I don’t feel good about it.
 Phoebe:That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest no one would have had to move at all.
 Phoebe:Okay scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf it’s just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What? Oh are you pregnant too?!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh the Olympics.
 Phoebe:I still cannot believe you’re engaged! (Ross looks at her) Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser.
 Phoebe:Already?!
 Phoebe:Yeah but y’know about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
 Phoebe:You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.
 Phoebe:No-no let me in!
 Phoebe:Yeah!

 Phoebe:Me too.
 Phoebe:Me too.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Yay!
 Phoebe:I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.

 Phoebe:What is that?
 Phoebe:Oh how did it go?
 Phoebe:What did he say?
 Phoebe:Yeah maybe.
 Phoebe:Any luck?
 Phoebe:(looks at Monica) Hey y’know what might cheer you up?
 Phoebe:No yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
 Phoebe:Not after this!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:What-what’s up?
 Phoebe:Really?! I looked into that. Yeah but I mean it costs like $60000 and y’know you can die. And you would die!
 Phoebe:So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
 Phoebe:Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable Ross let Ben address mine!
 Phoebe:Hey! Hey did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?
 Phoebe:I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester!
 Phoebe:Remembered what?
 Phoebe:Oh its so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
 Phoebe:See hes her lobster.
 Phoebe:(angrily) That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve been here!
 Phoebe:Yeah oh I’m sorry it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee which of course is decaf ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!
 Phoebe:(starting to cry) Thank you so much.
 Phoebe:I haven’t really had any yet.
 Phoebe:(to her babies) Stop it!
 Phoebe:One of the babies is kicking.
 Phoebe:It’s not kicking me it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh (looks down her dress)! Don’t make me come in there!
 Phoebe:Hey!! Get your ass back here Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in scared.)
 Phoebe:I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great! (Really excited) A party! (Really really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don’t know why.
 Phoebe:What the hell is this?! What did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right what’s my next present?!
 Phoebe:Hi guys.
 Phoebe:I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones y’know.
 Phoebe:Anyway I just wanted to say thank you it was just it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)
 Phoebe:Good. Y’know—no-no okay it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately so what’s happening with you?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
 Phoebe:Well let’s see it’s not. Really like that. Because you see that was an actual problem and uh yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…
 Phoebe:Alrighty here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)
 Phoebe:(sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh thanks.
 Phoebe:(sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
 Phoebe:Oh! No I-I think I just had a contraction.
 Phoebe:Yeah I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago and now I know that was definitely one.
 Phoebe:No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that that can happen near the end just somebody get the book.
 Phoebe:Well do you see any babies?
 Phoebe:Okay I guess. I mean… I don’t know it’s just I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.
 Phoebe:I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re when you’re done with the pregnant thing y’know then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know sitting around in my leather pants drinking Tequila.
 Phoebe:Okay that’s even sadder. Look I know I know what I got myself into it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like it’s like I know them y’know I mean-I mean it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay.
 Phoebe:Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
 Phoebe:They are gonna love me.
 Phoebe:Thanks you guys! Again.
 Phoebe:You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!

 Phoebe:Okay okay but Rachel’s gonna be here too can’t I just ask her this stuff?
 Phoebe:Ohhh I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding but I don’t—can’t get up.
 Phoebe:Great! Yeah could you bring me the newspaper?
 Phoebe:Oh have a great wedding!
 Phoebe:Oh hey Chandler I wanna hug you too!
 Phoebe:Oh and great! You might as well bring me my book it’s on the counter in your apartment.

 Phoebe:Oh no. Oh nothing.
 Phoebe:Okay I have a wedgie.

 Phoebe:Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah me neither.
 Phoebe:We thought you knew!
 Phoebe:Yeah we all know! We talk about it all the time!
 Phoebe:Oh no Ross doesn’t know anything.
 Phoebe:Well because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God that would be like telling Monica Hey you like things clean.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:So did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
 Phoebe:Well I think I can help you get over him.
 Phoebe:Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
 Phoebe:And a small piece of chocolate.
 Phoebe:And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)
 Phoebe:Uh only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah the pictures are for you the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
 Phoebe:Okay. Umm before we get started I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross I think he’s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay now close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease it’s—uck! Hah?
 Phoebe:Okay this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm let’s try some uh aversion therapy.
 Phoebe:Okay?
 Phoebe:So uh now look at the picture…

 Phoebe:Okay how do you feel now?
 Phoebe:Hello.
 Phoebe:Hey Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured he doesn’t care if he looks like you.

 Phoebe:Oo this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
 Phoebe:What is that?
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
 Phoebe:Which one do you have?
 Phoebe:But umm I mean did you talk to them about yknow…
 Phoebe:Oh. It was a long shot. Hey you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
 Phoebe:So here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing Id ever have to do but they were wrong this is. Oh I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay Ill settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alices sister has a pool but you lived in me. Okay so were cool. Yeah were gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well if youre gonna cry. (She starts crying.)
 Phoebe:I know.
 Phoebe:Yeah. You wont be able to take it.
 Phoebe:Theyre gonna call her Chandler.
 Phoebe:Works on you.
 Phoebe:Ugh PBS!
 Phoebe:Ugh whats right with them?
 Phoebe:Okay cause right after my mom killed herself I was just in this really bad place yknow personally. So I just thought that itd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
 Phoebe:All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didnt have keys!
 Phoebe:This isnt a good deed you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
 Phoebe:What-what are you talking about?!
 Phoebe:Yeah. So?
 Phoebe:Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
 Phoebe:Yeah its… Yknow theres—no you may not!
 Phoebe:Are you calling me selfish?!
 Phoebe:Im gonna find a selfless good dead. Im gonna beat you you evil genius.
 Phoebe:Hey Joey when you said the deal with Santa Clause you meant?
 Phoebe:Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
 Phoebe:I cannot believe I cant find a selfless good deed! Yknow that old guy that lives next to me? Well I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
 Phoebe:I will find a selfless good deed! Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
 Phoebe:Ooh-ohh!
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah but youve known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
 Phoebe:(on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
 Phoebe:Well it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
 Phoebe:(Thinks for a moment.) Aw dammit! (Slams the phone down.)
 Phoebe:Ooh its not a toy.
 Phoebe:(on phone) Hi Joey.
 Phoebe:I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
 Phoebe:Oh Im still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids whos moms didnt kill themselves so by supporting them Im doing a good thing but Im not happy about it. So there a selfless good deed.
 Phoebe:No it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
 Phoebe:Yeah not the one I had my eye on.
 Phoebe:Oh look-look Joeys on TV! Isnt that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore its selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
 Phoebe:Oh weird Chandler just told us hes got a conference there!
 Phoebe:Wait a minute! So when Emily comes youre just youre not gonna see Rachel anymore?
 Phoebe:Yeah thats better than my way.
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) Can you hear anything?
 Phoebe:Ooh Madlibs mine! (Grabs it.)
 Phoebe:I know its le poo right now but itll get better.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
 Phoebe:Ehh!!
 Phoebe:Come where?
 Phoebe:Okay but try and get Joey too.
 Phoebe:Oh sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his back.) Forever.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh hey Monica I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
 Phoebe:Were so stupid! Do you know whats going on in there? Theyre trying to take Joey!
 Phoebe:The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say Hi Phoebe!
 Phoebe:Count for what?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yeah my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didnt even have a family and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
 Phoebe:Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that its a fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)
 Phoebe:Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesnt she know me but at all! Plus I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvies husband said someone elses name in bed she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
 Phoebe:Oh I hate this. Everythings changing.
 Phoebe:I dont know what Im gonna do about this coat.
 Phoebe:That might work! (She gives him the coat.)
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:So listen you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
 Phoebe:He says that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm yknow bring in the next person I know who dies.
 Phoebe:This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay so to you death is fashion?! Thats really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Heres Phoebe umm sporting uh yknow cutting edge hairy carcass from yknow the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the mirror.) Cause I do.
 Phoebe:Nooo!!
 Phoebe:I think hes right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
 Phoebe:Oh I know.
 Phoebe:All right I cant sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on her fur coat.)
 Phoebe:Well Ive been reading up and for your information minks are not very nice. Okay I admit it! I love this coat! Okay I—its the best thing Ive ever had wrapped around me including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
 Phoebe:Are you still mad at us?
 Phoebe:Oh good! Because we have an Im sorry song.
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) Youre kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play but is stopped by…)
 Phoebe:Okay now youre just taking lines right out of the song!
 Phoebe:Yes! Exactly! And thats why…
 Phoebe:Okay lets get some perspective people; its not like Im wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
 Phoebe:Oh God I really missed that fat bastard!
 Phoebe:Hi Emily!
 Phoebe:Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
 Phoebe:(to the squirrel) Okay stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay theyre mean! And they hate squirrels! And yknow okay most of these probably wanted to be coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right fine now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here. (She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? Im cold!
 Phoebe:Umm do health inspectors work on commission?
 Phoebe:Its okay to laugh right?
 Phoebe:Okay. (She laughs harder.)
 Phoebe:Yum-my!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah! Id let him check out my kitchen floors.
 Phoebe:Hey you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that shed have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
 Phoebe:Yeah but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
 Phoebe:Okay she would love that! Yknow cause you know all the clean places to eat.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Hes so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
 Phoebe:(smiles) Show me the badge again.
 Phoebe:Shiny.
 Phoebe:(laughing) You are just nonstop!
 Phoebe:Why?!
 Phoebe:(awed) You have the power to do that?
 Phoebe:(excited) Shut it down.
 Phoebe:Oh I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
 Phoebe:Hey guys you know what Larry would say? He would say See you ladle. (Laughs.)
 Phoebe:Ooh absolutely!
 Phoebe:Ooh I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So no.
 Phoebe:Enh. Sure!
 Phoebe:Oh no-no this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today cause I was thirsty for milk yknow. (She takes a swig of it but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay lets go!
 Phoebe:Okay stop! Larry okay cant you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Yknow I mean it was really exciting at first but now its like okay so where are we gonna eat ever?
 Phoebe:Thank you. (To Gunther whos standing there frozen) Okay go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now if after dinner you still really need to bust someone I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
 Phoebe:Does anyone wanna watch TV?
 Phoebe:Monica your remote doesnt work.
 Phoebe:Oh. Aw forget it.
 Phoebe:Wow! See and I didnt think youd be able to come up with anything.
 Phoebe:I dont know about that. Ive got one thats worse.
 Phoebe:Oh did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes mines worse!
 Phoebe:Oh this life! Oh okay no Chandlers is worse.
 Phoebe:Of course you dont sweetie. Youre brand new.
 Phoebe:Oh no I know! I know! Its the one where Joey got Monicas turkey stuck on his head!
 Phoebe:(surprised) Hello?
 Phoebe:Joey? Whats going on?
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Monicas gonna totally freak out!
 Phoebe:Well of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:No its not supposed to be funny its supposed to be scary.
 Phoebe:All right hold on! Okay lets just all think.
 Phoebe:Oh wait! That cant be the one Rachels talking about. She didnt even know that happened. So which one was it?
 Phoebe:Oh I cant believe you called her fat.
 Phoebe:Oh no I have the cutest Christmas story!
 Phoebe:Fine all right mine had a dwarf that got broke in half but yknow whatever.
 Phoebe:What am I sitting on?
 Phoebe:(taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!
 Phoebe:Umm Wethering Heights. Im taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Well I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Yknow and this time I thought Id go for something yknow a little more intellectual with a less painful final exam.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Ooh you should come with me! Oh yeah then Id have someone to sit with!
 Phoebe:Yeah! Okay—ooh but are you going to have time to read it?
 Phoebe:This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh I have to finish.
 Phoebe:Okay look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
 Phoebe:Okay this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and the gang reads it.)
 Phoebe:Someday Ill tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
 Phoebe:Well he stabbed me first!!
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:I thought you said you read it in high school.
 Phoebe:Okay umm its this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliffs character. I totally get symbolism.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!
 Phoebe:Well how would you know?! You didnt even read it!
 Phoebe:I think that uh yours is a question with many answers.
 Phoebe:Would you care to venture one?
 Phoebe:Are you just repeating what Im saying?
 Phoebe:Okay then.
 Phoebe:Yeah but why didnt you just say that you didnt read the book?!
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:You didnt read this one either?!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:No! You shouldve read it yourself!
 Phoebe:Fine! Okay all right so Jane Eyre first of all youd think shes a woman but shes not. Shes a cyborg.
 Phoebe:Yeah this book was light years ahead of its time.
 Phoebe:Umm Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
 Phoebe:(smiling) Im sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
 Phoebe:Well I snapped! Okay? You werent taking the class seriously.
 Phoebe:Well yeah! Fun is good but yknow I also wanted to learn. Yknow people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
 Phoebe:All right wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Lets give our friend Joey a chance to explain why hes such a big pervert!
 Phoebe:Whats going on?
 Phoebe:So thats why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
 Phoebe:I really thought you making a good point. I mean yknow until you got cut off.
 Phoebe:I dont know! I didnt come with her!
 Phoebe:Hey you guys guess what?
 Phoebe:Ohh you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations.
 Phoebe:(Excitedly) Yeah I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean last year I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year I’m going to do the whole city.
 Phoebe:Ohh they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie but I’m the only one who can sing Merry Christmas in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.
 Phoebe:Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo and Merry Christmas. (A man put some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Heres some joy. (She waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well its going okay.
 Phoebe:Oh thanks!
 Phoebe:Wow!
 Phoebe:Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
 Phoebe:Just get your nails done?
 Phoebe:Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays heres your joy. (She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)
 Phoebe:Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
 Phoebe:Wait you cant take the money out.
 Phoebe:But cant you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
 Phoebe:Okay Seasons Greetings and everything but still…
 Phoebe:Oh Im going to give him something else besides joy just… (She scowls at him.)
 Phoebe:Thank you Happy Holidays.
 Phoebe:Now thats trash. Young lady you cant… (The lady ignores her and walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady she donated trash!
 Phoebe:Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charitys on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) Its nine oclock in the morning!
 Phoebe:Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldnt believe what people put in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay does this look like a garbage can to you?
 Phoebe:Does it look like an ashtray?
 Phoebe:Does it look like a urinal?
 Phoebe:Well yeah! But Im not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
 Phoebe:Yeah Im gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but yknow what? I cant go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldnt be friends with you guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)
 Phoebe:Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute open up your hand; let me take a look. (The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the lint away.) Whats this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)
 Phoebe:Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought I told you to get outta here!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:That chick cant handle my corner.
 Phoebe:Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (The same old lady walks by again.) All right Ill give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. (The old lady.)
 Phoebe:Its so obvious why doesnt he just ask?
 Phoebe:You too!
 Phoebe:Ooh! Thats a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
 Phoebe:Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
 Phoebe:Really?! How come?
 Phoebe:Do you want me to teach you? Im a great teacher.
 Phoebe:Well I taught me and I love me.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh this must be killing you.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no you dont touch the guitar! First you learn here (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the guitar.)
 Phoebe:Okay lesson one chords. Now I dont know the actual names of the chords but umm I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while Im doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note For this one youll have to use your imagination cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them youll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then this is Bear Claw. Okay umm Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)
 Phoebe:Hey everybody Rachel was so good today. She didnt gossip at all.
 Phoebe:Ooh you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)
 Phoebe:Did you did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
 Phoebe:Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings. Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
 Phoebe:Then dont touch one!!
 Phoebe:Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord in fact he does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph did you even study at all last night?
 Phoebe:Then do Iceberg!
 Phoebe:G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? (Joey doesnt answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God!
 Phoebe:No but youre questioning my method!
 Phoebe:Yknow none of my other student thought I was stupid.
 Phoebe:Yeah well yknow maybe you just need to try a little harder!
 Phoebe:Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But dont come crying to me when everyones sick and tired of hearing you play Bad Bad Leroy Brown!!
 Phoebe:Oh fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)
 Phoebe:No I cant talk to you! I dont have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh!
 Phoebe:No!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Okay Im gonna go too. Im gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough someones bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
 Phoebe:Bye! (She exits leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)
 Phoebe:Hey! Its raining. I dont want to fly in the rain. So…
 Phoebe:Thats weird. (Pause.) I bet theyre doing it.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way you and Emily are in the past and you cant be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
 Phoebe:Exactly! Because its in the past!
 Phoebe:Okay then what happened?
 Phoebe:(gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) Youll get your turn!
 Phoebe:Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This is not over!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What were you doing?
 Phoebe:Oh nobodys judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)
 Phoebe:You two will have very hairy children.
 Phoebe:So are you actually gonna see her again?
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm.
 Phoebe:Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
 Phoebe:Ohhh.

 Phoebe:Yeah her first day on a new spiritual plane and shes gonna come to the coffeehouse!
 Phoebe:Its okay. Actually yknow what its kinda cool. Cause its like yknow one life ends and another begins.
 Phoebe:Well umm okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
 Phoebe:It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; Okay dear you go get the eggs and Im gonna get the yogurt and well meet at the checkout counter. And yknow what? We will meet at the checkout counter.

 Phoebe:Come on you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? Hes gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
 Phoebe:Well I said I told him yknow that I was the executor person of Francis will and that I needed to talk to him so Im gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
 Phoebe:All right well I just cant think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
 Phoebe:All right Id better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
 Phoebe:Umm no not at first cause I-I dont want to freak him out
 Phoebe:Yknow its funny youd think Id be angry. I mean youd think Id wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately Im past it.
 Phoebe:All right.
 Phoebe:Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
 Phoebe:As a masseuse and a human Im begging you never do that to anyone!
 Phoebe:(seeing the look on Chandlers face) He-he does not like it! He hates it! Hes in pain!
 Phoebe:Umm thank you for meeting with me.
 Phoebe:Come sit. (Hes hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on the arm of the couch.) Umm all righty before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Huh?
 Phoebe:Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm (looking in her purse) this lipstick.
 Phoebe:Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so Im going to get out my official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay so question 1) You and uh you were married to Francis daughter Lilly is that correct?
 Phoebe:Okay umm question 2) Umm did that marriage end A. Happily B. Medium or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
 Phoebe:Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)
 Phoebe:Hmm okay total abandonment. Okay reasons for abandonment A. Top secret government work B. Amnesia or C. Or youre just a selfish irresponsible bad bad man?
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
 Phoebe:Lillys dead. (He looks up in shock.)
 Phoebe:Shes dead.
 Phoebe:Well if she isnt then cremating her was a big mistake.
 Phoebe:17 years ago.
 Phoebe:Well Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe (pause) is on this couch.
 Phoebe:Yep lipstick and a daughter big day for you!
 Phoebe:Yes. Well thats neither here nor there.
 Phoebe:Yknow what it doesn’t matter what you say its not gonna make a difference anyway so you can just go.
 Phoebe:Thats a defense?
 Phoebe:You make up songs?
 Phoebe:Well I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)
 Phoebe:Not yet no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)
 Phoebe:(looking out the window) Oh hey you guys look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
 Phoebe:Its amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or Im gonna beat you to it.
 Phoebe:(looking out the window) Oh look! Theres Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each others clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!

 Phoebe:(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
 Phoebe:You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like yknow doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
 Phoebe:Oh! Oh I cant believe it! I mean I think its great! For him. She might be able to do better.
 Phoebe:Okay so now they know that you know and they dont know that Rachel knows?
 Phoebe:Or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
 Phoebe:Well yknow every time that they say that like theyre doing laundry well just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
 Phoebe:No! You dont have to do anything! Just dont tell them that we know!
 Phoebe:Well you could use your position yknow as the roommate.
 Phoebe:And then. I would use yknow the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
 Phoebe:Okay watch learn and dont eat my cookie.
 Phoebe:Hey! Ooh wow that jacket looks great on you!
 Phoebe:(feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
 Phoebe:Well if you really wanna know Im—Oh! I cant tell you this.
 Phoebe:Well actually youre the one person I cant tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
 Phoebe:I think its just yknow that I havent been with a guy in so long and how sometimes youre looking for something and you just don’t even see that its right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no have I said to much? Well its just something to think about. I know I will.
 Phoebe:I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
 Phoebe:But theres a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
 Phoebe:Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
 Phoebe:Yeah why dont you just find another apartment?
 Phoebe:He broke that.
 Phoebe:I wouldnt bring that up it would probably just bum him out.
 Phoebe:(in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.
 Phoebe:Eh?
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:Ill have to get back to you on that. Okay bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!

 Phoebe:I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm I brought some wine. Would you like some?
 Phoebe:So here we are. Nervous?
 Phoebe:No I want this to happen.
 Phoebe:Maybe maybe Ill dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance thats silly at the same time.)
 Phoebe:Thanks! Yknow that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:No. No! Its just yknow first I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
 Phoebe:Hes not backing down. He went to get lotion.

 Phoebe:Yeah uh-huh a 100 dollars.
 Phoebe:Yeah but they didnt ask me! Yknow? This way Im just yknow the exotic generous stranger. Thats always fun to be.
 Phoebe:No Im not. No! If anything Im making you look better! Theyll see you talking to me and thats--Im a hit!
 Phoebe:Hey!

 Phoebe:Oh I was telling them about you and Emily. Yknow try to get some sympathy.
 Phoebe:But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
 Phoebe:Yeah I think I told it wrong. Yknow we should talk about that because I dont totally understand what happened there.
 Phoebe:Oh okay see? Things are looking up already!
 Phoebe:All right everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you dont like him! He-he didnt give you any money he raised his own hand when I asked Who hear likes Ross and hes wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-Ill be honest with you guys when I first met Ross I didnt like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that hes really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean all Im saying is dont judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean I like all you guys now but when I first meet you yknow Kurt I thought yknow abrasive drunk umm Lola mind numbingly stupid! And okay you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman whore a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So I think you all know what I mean.
 Phoebe:Obviously I didnt think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
 Phoebe:Aw and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
 Phoebe:All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel! (Donates it.) How much more do we need?
 Phoebe:Okay dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh my God this is a police badge!
 Phoebe:Yeah I should probably take it back. Ooh but you know what? While Im at the police station I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in hope.)
 Phoebe:Oh. Oh! Maam? Excuse me maam?
 Phoebe:You cant put your cigarette out on a tree!
 Phoebe:No but you shouldnt! Dont ever do that again.
 Phoebe:Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
 Phoebe:Yeah thats right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book em.
 Phoebe:Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer you apologize to the tree.
 Phoebe:You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!
 Phoebe:Okay cancel backup! Cancel backup!
 Phoebe:…so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And Im all Buffay Homicide. (Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!
 Phoebe:I know but Im having so much fun doing good deeds.
 Phoebe:You could get arrested right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at her.) All right yeah I gotta take it back. Im totally drunk with power. (She heads for the door just as Joey enters.)
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Hey.
 Phoebe:Excuse me is this your car?
 Phoebe:Well I dont think its very nice of you to park here yknow youre blocking the entrance.
 Phoebe:Well its a problem for me which means its a problem for you cause Im a cop. (Shows the badge.)
 Phoebe:Ohh no. (Pause) Oh okay so youre a cop which means you can park anywhere cause I know that cause Im a cop too. So all right keep up the good work. 10-4. (Tries to leave.)
 Phoebe:I-Im with the umm the 57th.
 Phoebe:Im in vice. Yeah in fact Im undercover right now. Im a whore.
 Phoebe:Umm do you know umm Sipowicz?
 Phoebe:Yeah big guy kinda bald.

 Phoebe:I-I sure will take care. (Starts walking off.)
 Phoebe:Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs away.)
 Phoebe:Ooh God its him! Its that cop! God I cant believe it! He found me!
 Phoebe:Well if Im going down Im taking you (Points at all of them) with me. (They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? Thats one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay you can arrest me. Fine. But youll never make it stick and you know it!
 Phoebe:Yep! As long as you understand that Im going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand hell make you look like a fool. A fool!
 Phoebe:I would love it if I werent here!

 Phoebe:I cant believe this!
 Phoebe:No but it is fast. Isnt it?
 Phoebe:No I like him a lot but I dont think Im ready for this!
 Phoebe:I dont know. Ill just handle it—Ill ask you to talk to him!
 Phoebe:Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him make him scared like you! Make him a…man!
 Phoebe:Hmm did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you cant even do that right! God!
 Phoebe:Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of here good for nothing.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)
 Phoebe:Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm.
 Phoebe:No thats not true. If youre not moving forward youre just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:That is so sweet. But dont you think its a little too soon? I mean theres so much we dont know about each other.
 Phoebe:I just—I dont want us to jump into something were not ready for.
 Phoebe:I really dont want to mess up what we have. Im just—Im worried its gonna be a big mistake.
 Phoebe:Which is why my answer is yes!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh! (They hug.) Im so…happy. (Shes not happy.)
 Phoebe:Were moving in together! Isnt it great! Yay!
 Phoebe:I know Im so excited!
 Phoebe:Well youre not more excited than I am! No way! Im the most excited!
 Phoebe:Okay yeah Ill see you later! Dont forget about the moving in!
 Phoebe:I couldnt tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe itll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus think of all the money Ill save on stamps.
 Phoebe:No I just heard when people live together they split the cost of stamps. Dont they?
 Phoebe:Oh Im sorry the oven mitts really freaked me out.
 Phoebe:No nothing.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:No as soon as something opens up well move right in. Unless it doesnt have a pool I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)
 Phoebe:Uh-huh!
 Phoebe:(sits down) Yeah I feel great. Cause were moving in together.
 Phoebe:Yeah uh-huh there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?
 Phoebe:Umm yeah! Todays.
 Phoebe:(looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
 Phoebe:Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! (Pause) Im sorry! (Puts her head down.)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Thats so sweet.
 Phoebe:Living with you would make me happy.
 Phoebe:No I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
 Phoebe:Yes. Definitely! Yes! Lets live in an apartment that we both live in! (Hugs him.)
 Phoebe:Oh wait one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! Ive always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms (sees the look on his face) which was never!
 Phoebe:I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! Its such a beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh I can stay here all day.
 Phoebe:We could have breakfast in bed…
 Phoebe:Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.
 Phoebe:(entering) Oh good youre all up.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah thats over.
 Phoebe:He shot a bird!
 Phoebe:Yeah. Yeah Ill be alright.
 Phoebe:(catches it) Nah I dont feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Ohh give him a kiss for me!
 Phoebe:Bye!
 Phoebe:(after hes gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didnt mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
 Phoebe:Im trying but man that guy can push my buttons!
 Phoebe:Look I dont wanna talk about it. Okay?
 Phoebe:You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
 Phoebe:Uh its a piece of paper and it says Ross on it.
 Phoebe:Ohh-oh chilling!
 Phoebe:Oh wait my grandmothers dead.
 Phoebe:No! No her cab! She probably wont be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
 Phoebe:Oh hey Joey! Whats up?
 Phoebe:Yeah Ive been around.
 Phoebe:Ooh if you take the northern route theres a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay I must protest this Ive lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin on the other hand might be a different story.}
 Phoebe:But on the southern route theres a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
 Phoebe:Oh I know a way that you can decide! All right Im going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
 Phoebe:Good but wait. Okay all right here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
 Phoebe:Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
 Phoebe:Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
 Phoebe:No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
 Phoebe:North route or south route?
 Phoebe:Bamn! There you go! Huh?
 Phoebe:Oh this guy again. (She ignores him.)
 Phoebe:Umm no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a table previously.)
 Phoebe:Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
 Phoebe:Bye!
 Phoebe:Oh Im sorry. I didnt see you there.
 Phoebe:Well if you dont know I cant help you.
 Phoebe:Well I cant help you.
 Phoebe:Apology accepted.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:(quietly) Bye fat ass.
 Phoebe:I dont know! I dont remember!
 Phoebe:Oh no I am mad at you. I know that much. But I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:No that made me feel precious.
 Phoebe:That game should not be played without my supervision.
 Phoebe:Whats in the bag?
 Phoebe:I do!
 Phoebe:Ooh that is definitely Chandler Joey or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!
 Phoebe:Hey dude!
 Phoebe:Oh thats my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks Joey shes having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)
 Phoebe:Okay Joey? Chandlers here he was wondering… (We hear the dial tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay I guess he ran out of change.
 Phoebe:No dont-dont say Im sorry with porn!
 Phoebe:Yknow what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. Thats prison.
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm.
 Phoebe:Fauna.
 Phoebe:Garfunkle.

 Phoebe:Oh my God I remember now! We were playing chess!
 Phoebe:Oh come on! Yes remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess you said I was boring and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! (Realizes) Okay theres a chance this may have been a dream.
 Phoebe:Why? Just cause youre too lazy to get up off your touchie?

 Phoebe:Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Oh! Okay that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
 Phoebe:That is so weird! I had a dream that youd have lunch with Richard.
 Phoebe:But again Simmons. Go on.
 Phoebe:Ooh! So now why cant we tell Chandler?
 Phoebe:Oh I cant believe you guys lasted a whole year!
 Phoebe:Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
 Phoebe:On a totally different bet.
 Phoebe:Awww! Now youre just my annoying friend Chandler.

 Phoebe:Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah so you can walk around naked.
 Phoebe:Naked alone time.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
 Phoebe:So so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
 Phoebe:Okay what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one from her purse.)
 Phoebe:Ah-ha! Okay (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1 London 0! Ill be right back. (Gets up and heads aft.)

 Phoebe:Oh no. [The patented version.]
 Phoebe:(To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!
 Phoebe:Okay London 1…
 Phoebe:Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
 Phoebe:For 99 cents Id eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay I can totally settle down here. Its got everything I could ever want including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!
 Phoebe:Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him he spots them coming and panics.) Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)
 Phoebe:Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
 Phoebe:So youre a gladiator! Wow!
 Phoebe:Monica had lunch with Richard.
 Phoebe:Noo! But that wouldve been so cool!
 Phoebe:I love Vegas!
 Phoebe:Thanks.
 Phoebe:Yknow Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! Its only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so sorry.
 Phoebe:So go fix it! Go find Chandler! Hes probably up in your room! Tell him that youre sorry and that you love him.
 Phoebe:Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas number one!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Ohh you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So wheres Monica? Did you guys make up?
 Phoebe:But she just came up here!
 Phoebe:I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
 Phoebe:Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didnt feel anything for him. She loves you!
 Phoebe:Yes! Now she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
 Phoebe:Good. (After he leaves she puts on Joeys gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!
 Phoebe:(sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!
 Phoebe:You guys are here! Yay!
 Phoebe:(sees Rachels face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and youre Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the slot machine Phoebe was just at.)
 Phoebe:Yeah! (Motions to her face indicating all of Rachels make-up.)
 Phoebe:Whoa what kind of party was this?
 Phoebe:Ugh!
 Phoebe:Thats like the third time that ladys won on a machine I was playing.
 Phoebe:M-M-Mole people?

 Phoebe:Ohh! You made up!
 Phoebe:Ohh get a room.
 Phoebe:I know. Use it.
 Phoebe:Oh well lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) Thats it! You and me outside!
 Phoebe:Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady your lurking days are over!
 Phoebe:Yeah from now on everyone you lurk Im gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else Im gonna be one step ahead of you every single time! And then Ill be on your ass every hour of every day til Monday because thats when I go home. When do you leave?
 Phoebe:What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
 Phoebe:I won! I won! I finally won!
 Phoebe:Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)

 Phoebe:She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)
 Phoebe:How about we talk about this over dinner?
 Phoebe:No! No you cant arrest me! No!! I wont go back! I wont go back to that hell hole!!
 Phoebe:Oh okay. (Walks out.)
 Phoebe:(entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. Im a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks down) Ooh what did I do with my file-a-facts? I mustve left it in conference room B.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! Theyre identical! Now Ive never seen anything like that in the business world.

 Phoebe:Well maybe you wouldn’t have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!
 Phoebe:What’s the big deal y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.
 Phoebe:Yeah if you get married in Vegas you’re only married in Vegas.
 Phoebe:(shocked) Really?!
 Phoebe:Oh my God!—Eh! Well…
 Phoebe:Oh Joey I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
 Phoebe:What about my cab?
 Phoebe:No Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
 Phoebe:I don’t know it’s such a long trip.
 Phoebe:Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
 Phoebe:All right. Although I don’t think we need one I never stopped loving you.
 Phoebe:Um-hmm yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
 Phoebe:Well you don’t.
 Phoebe:Good! Good! I was just testing you.
 Phoebe:No we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
 Phoebe:Hell I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!
 Phoebe:Oh-oh that’s your thing.
 Phoebe:You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.
 Phoebe:Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk.
 Phoebe:Okay you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!
 Phoebe:Well you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment you greedy sleeper!
 Phoebe:Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
 Phoebe:Sing!!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face) a rapist or a killer or something!
 Phoebe:Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you are you a rapist?!
 Phoebe:Do you like car games?
 Phoebe:I love the license plate game!
 Phoebe:No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the partition.)
 Phoebe:Oh okay.
 Phoebe:And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter so the ball’s pretty much in your court.
 Phoebe:Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!
 Phoebe:You can still sleep at night and stuff.
 Phoebe:Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
 Phoebe:Is it a meatball sub?
 Phoebe:No thanks I’ve already seen one.
 Phoebe:Always.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Always.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:(running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
 Phoebe:Oh there’s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.) Good timing my God huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)
 Phoebe:Oh the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab’s roof and it pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn’t get the annulment?!!
 Phoebe:Ross?!
 Phoebe:Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say Ross Geller Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay Buried Alive.
 Phoebe:So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op woman! Sorry.
 Phoebe:Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
 Phoebe:Hey Rach!
 Phoebe:Sorry mix up. Hey how was the movie?
 Phoebe:Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the roof again and off they go.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:No why?
 Phoebe:(gasps) You’re pregnant!
 Phoebe:Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant what would you name it? Hint Phoebe.
 Phoebe:Guys I’m happy too.
 Phoebe:Wow! Big day huh? People moving in people getting annulled… (Winks at Ross.)
 Phoebe:Hmm something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel what could that be?!
 Phoebe:Ross it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times you’ll still have a life you’ll go on dates…
 Phoebe:Ross you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
 Phoebe:Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here I’ll show you! Come here.
 Phoebe:(to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time but wouldn’t you date him?
 Phoebe:Okay so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?
 Phoebe:Okay what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?
 Phoebe:(interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
 Phoebe:(leaning to him) She said He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. (He glares at her.)
 Phoebe:Well I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
 Phoebe:Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
 Phoebe:Yes and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say Well done! Bravo Meg.
 Phoebe:(to Joey and Chandler) Okay bye!
 Phoebe:So? Did you get the annulment?
 Phoebe:I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
 Phoebe:Yeah complicated ‘cause of the love.
 Phoebe:I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.
 Phoebe:Oh we do but not just yet.
 Phoebe:Okay umm well first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.
 Phoebe:I know. Then I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
 Phoebe:But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.
 Phoebe:I don’t want to go into the whole thing but umm we have words and I kill him.
 Phoebe:Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh what?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Well that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
 Phoebe:My roommate.
 Phoebe:Yes Denise. Denise!
 Phoebe:Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:So what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
 Phoebe:You didn’t tell her did you?
 Phoebe:Of course not because you’re in love with her.
 Phoebe:What do you mean comforted her?
 Phoebe:Ah-ha! A classic sign of love the hug!
 Phoebe:Yeah not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of Ross’s cookie.)
 Phoebe:Okay just tell me this did you or did you not smell her hair?
 Phoebe:Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross you’re a scientist.
 Phoebe:(taking his coffee) Okay whatever you say. But just be careful all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.
 Phoebe:Okay I didn’t understand that but y’know maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
 Phoebe:Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.
 Phoebe:Umm I’m trying to move that pencil. (There’s a pencil lying on the table.)
 Phoebe:It worked!
 Phoebe:Wait no look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) Two bedroom two bath must be non-smoker Satan worshipers okay… Oh yeah but it’s on the ground floor.
 Phoebe:I saw it.
 Phoebe:Umm I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
 Phoebe:I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (Pause) Okay just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so not stupid.
 Phoebe:No. No I won’t. But I should tell you this this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her but he really did and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay that’s a lie.
 Phoebe:(singing) I found you in my bed! 
 Phoebe:Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
 Phoebe:(on the microphone accidentally) Yes.
 Phoebe:Ross I know what you’re thinking.
 Phoebe:That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just you’re very sad.
 Phoebe:What?!!
 Phoebe:No! (Ross’s phone rings.)
 Phoebe:Yeah Professor and Mrs.
 Phoebe:Oh! Yeah y’know you and Ross are still married.
 Phoebe:Just kidding!
 Phoebe:(To Ross) Saved your ass.
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:Well you know that psychic I see?
 Phoebe:Well she told me that I’m gonna die this week so I’m kinda bummed about that.
 Phoebe:Yeah and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
 Phoebe:I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
 Phoebe:No ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine) leans back and starts reading.)
 Phoebe:Oh this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Ugh it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh by the way do you think you could—(Groans hacks and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)
 Phoebe:I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
 Phoebe:Yeah thanks. And listen can you do me a favor? Could you just umm wake me up in a couple hours y’know if you can.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What’s going on?
 Phoebe:Hey! Maybe you’ll die!
 Phoebe:No we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.
 Phoebe:No-no it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Listen to this! My reading was wrong I’m not going die!
 Phoebe:Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!
 Phoebe:Eh better her than me! Hey let’s bake cookies!
 Phoebe:Have you really done this before?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
 Phoebe:(overdoing it) Oh my God!!
 Phoebe:Okay this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
 Phoebe:Another lie. You have a sickness!
 Phoebe:(coming in from the bathroom) Oh good good you guys are here! Listen how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
 Phoebe:Okay well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay and uh by the way they’re not actually puppies they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay see ya! (Exits.)
 Phoebe:(stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!
 Phoebe:What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while I don’t have a roommate.
 Phoebe:Maybe you could be my roommate!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Umm she said she’d be back December 26th.
 Phoebe:(rapidly) I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?
 Phoebe:Na-uh no we are all responsible for our own babies.
 Phoebe:That sounds really great but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
 Phoebe:Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
 Phoebe:No Chandler they can swallow one of those little parts! And also look at his smooth area that’s just gonna mess them up.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Oh look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
 Phoebe:Oh I can still do that.
 Phoebe:How did that happen?!!
 Phoebe:Yeah but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
 Phoebe:What?! No you can’t you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!
 Phoebe:But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!
 Phoebe:But no because a doctor won’t be able to help him it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
 Phoebe:I’m pretty sure it’s gun.
 Phoebe:A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! (They don’t stop.) No! What would what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)
 Phoebe:Me taking care of you is no problem huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay I’m gonna take that spit bubble as Yeah I do! Okay after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie I’ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at the garbage without looking misses and knocks over a vase and flowers which fall to the floor and break.) Okay I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it we’re at Monica’s. (She crawls over disposes of the diaper picks up the flowers and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well that’s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Okay good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well you can’t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh you’re a lot mischievous! Well it’ll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! (They both have disappeared as well.)
 Phoebe:(exhausted) How do you feel?
 Phoebe:Okay so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em bathed ‘em and put ‘em to bed.
 Phoebe:I know the babies are asleep.
 Phoebe:I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
 Phoebe:So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
 Phoebe:Well how much do you think he needs?
 Phoebe:Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
 Phoebe:And also my birthday.
 Phoebe:What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!
 Phoebe:Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
 Phoebe:My God I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.
 Phoebe:Well what you’re wearing is fine for that.
 Phoebe:I have plans.
 Phoebe:That’s right.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now it’s too late for me but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the door.)
 Phoebe:You guys we said we were gonna have fun! Come on hey remember the time… (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don’t remember?
 Phoebe:Well this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.
 Phoebe:Come on there’s gotta be something.
 Phoebe:Good! Great! You can go first.
 Phoebe:Good that’s a good one. Okay Monica anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
 Phoebe:Okay good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?
 Phoebe:Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
 Phoebe:Yeah I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey uh remember the roller blades?
 Phoebe:Hey! I call her!
 Phoebe:Yeah we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
 Phoebe:Well one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!
 Phoebe:I know I took it hard too.
 Phoebe:Hey how are you guys doing?
 Phoebe:Okay you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay you guys… STOP!! (They stop.) I know that I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.
 Phoebe:Well deep-deep-deep down!
 Phoebe:Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)
 Phoebe:Hey you guys I don’t mean to make things worse but umm I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
 Phoebe:You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
 Phoebe:What else?
 Phoebe:That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
 Phoebe:Okay Rachel I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!
 Phoebe:Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?
 Phoebe:Ready?
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:its...
 Phoebe:and…

 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Why? Why would you do that?
 Phoebe:(jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah uh-huh its me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
 Phoebe:Please Rachel I am not an idiot. (Runs off)

 Phoebe:So?
 Phoebe:Why do you care?
 Phoebe:But people that you dont know and will never see again.
 Phoebe:Well I didnt get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no okay. No no I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah okay. Youre uptight.
 Phoebe:Thats okay Rachel. Im not judging you; thats just who you are. Me. Im more free yknow? I run like I did when I was a kid cause thats the only way its fun. Yknow I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Yknow like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbors dog.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:See? And you dont care if people are staring its just for a second cause then youre gone!
 Phoebe:(Walking over and Sitting down.) Hey.
 Phoebe:Rachel?
 Phoebe:I’m uhh making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.
 Phoebe:Oh my God. What happened?
 Phoebe:Well that’s great! Congratulations!! (She hugs Rachel.)
 Phoebe:(Hugging her again.) You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
 Phoebe:Thank you.
 Phoebe:Now you will not believe this. But I was in the copy room making copies and Ralph Lauren came in.
 Phoebe:Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
 Phoebe:Totally.
 Phoebe:Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know we’re making out. You know.
 Phoebe:No!
 Phoebe:What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married? (Rachel looks at her.) No yeah I should.
 Phoebe:Hey. Here. (Hands Chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of Ralph.) Ohh who’s the silver fox?
 Phoebe:That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
 Phoebe:Yeah no Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
 Phoebe:Ohhh.
 Phoebe:Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
 Phoebe:But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.
 Phoebe:Well hey what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh did she ever think of that?
 Phoebe:Just for a second.
 Phoebe:Well the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
 Phoebe:Ohh sleep with Kenny.
 Phoebe:Ohh yes it would.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Wow that sounds great! And what are you making Monica in case Rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!
 Phoebe:And who else is going to be there?
 Phoebe:Yeah and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
 Phoebe:Rach Rach I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
 Phoebe:Yeah I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know I mean he used to be just y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller dream hunk.
 Phoebe:Rachel?
 Phoebe:Okay look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.
 Phoebe:Monica leave him alone!
 Phoebe:So now Rach this is a traditional English trifle isn’t it?
 Phoebe:Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
 Phoebe:I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. (Faking dissapointment.) Ohhh no.
 Phoebe:Rachel come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) Okay I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream about Jack.
 Phoebe:I dunno let’s see! So okay I dreamt that we were gonna get married and he left becuz he had to go fight a fire. And um so okay I went to a night club and I saw him making out with a girl.
 Phoebe:Yeah but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse who by the way was totally coming on to me and please that is not gonna happen.
 Phoebe:Five minutes ago a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well not nothing I am still a woman.
 Phoebe:(joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!
 Phoebe:That is nice and we’re done. TADA!
 Phoebe:Yeah Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.
 Phoebe:No-no we do it every year!
 Phoebe:No yeah we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.
 Phoebe:But we have to!
 Phoebe:Well then you should look with us.
 Phoebe:Oh that’s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!
 Phoebe:Ooh ooh we have a live one!
 Phoebe:Ooh who’s it for?
 Phoebe:Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
 Phoebe:Yeah and you have nothing to worry about cos theyre all crap!
 Phoebe:Ohhh. Thanks Chandler theyre great!
 Phoebe:Oh okay Im sorry thank you for my azzz.
 Phoebe:Hey! Look who I found!
 Phoebe:Y’know birds have a very good sense of direction and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
 Phoebe:Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay c’mon guys show us where the presents are!
 Phoebe:Hmm how about my azzz?
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:No don’t look directly at them!
 Phoebe:Alright no we could look at them!
 Phoebe:Oh this one’s for Chandler. Here.
 Phoebe:And the big one’s for me!
 Phoebe:Hee hee!
 Phoebe:Will you get us better gifts?
 Phoebe:Oh yes I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
 Phoebe:She’s made it pretty clear it is not going to happen.
 Phoebe:Yeah well we’ll see.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:(sees the table) Ooh what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
 Phoebe:Umm a flea market?
 Phoebe:Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She’s opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
 Phoebe:Y’know? Ooh you can almost smell the opium.
 Phoebe:How much was it?
 Phoebe:500 bucks at a flea market?!
 Phoebe:Oh no.
 Phoebe:A dollar?
 Phoebe:Ohh okay they gave you the old time pricing.
 Phoebe:Well what period is it from?
 Phoebe:Yes yes I do. God oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or…
 Phoebe:(gasps) White Plains. Oh it sounds like such a magical place.
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Okay. Hey—Ooh cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.)
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
 Phoebe:Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off but drags the sheet with her which spills the wine.) Noo!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Ross where did you get this?!
 Phoebe:Wow! Oh my God well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
 Phoebe:Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
 Phoebe:Oh Ross calm down I’ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at Rachel)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:(sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
 Phoebe:(gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
 Phoebe:Ah!
 Phoebe:Yeah no I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should you should ask Rachel to help.
 Phoebe:Oh come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
 Phoebe:No! I do want to!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
 Phoebe:Uck look at this! Pottery Barn yuck!
 Phoebe:No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!
 Phoebe:That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
 Phoebe:Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
 Phoebe:No-no-no but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!
 Phoebe:I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?
 Phoebe:But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?
 Phoebe:Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
 Phoebe:But at least the apothecary table is real.
 Phoebe:I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey.
 Phoebe:Wh-wh-what are you doing?
 Phoebe:Oh I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). Yikes!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah. Aw remember the days when you used to go out to the barn lift up your shirt and bend over?
 Phoebe:Rachel.
 Phoebe:I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither.
 Phoebe:I guess it was kinda funny.
 Phoebe:Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!
 Phoebe:No okay you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.
 Phoebe:Ya you know Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know you can just walk all over her.
 Phoebe:Oh okay (laughing) you’re not a pushover.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:That true I am flaky.
 Phoebe:Yeah totally.
 Phoebe:That’s great. Good for you guys.
 Phoebe:Who said you were?
 Phoebe:Oh I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.
 Phoebe:Really? I’ve heard better.
 Phoebe:(to Monica) Y’know suddenly I find you very attractive.
 Phoebe:Wow! That is a bad audition.
 Phoebe:(returning from the bathroom) Rach you’re in my seat.
 Phoebe:Hey I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
 Phoebe:Yeah well I kinda thought.
 Phoebe:Yeah Joey that is so gross!
 Phoebe:(giggles) I’m pretty.
 Phoebe:Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh y’know what? No. (Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming in it.) I know it’s in here somewhere.
 Phoebe:(To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter?
 Phoebe:Never mind I got it.
 Phoebe:Of course yeah!
 Phoebe:Ooh I like cards.
 Phoebe:Seriously I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.
 Phoebe:I would love that job!
 Phoebe:Sorry Jill.
 Phoebe:Oh well all right I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you I got uh this y’know I want a job sweater. (Holds up the same sweater.)
 Phoebe:And and then I got uh these are apartment pants.
 Phoebe:Yeah you never heard of them?
 Phoebe:What about what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants how dumb was I?
 Phoebe:(gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it!
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Umm I think there’s something you should maybe know.
 Phoebe:No. No. It’s just I was umm I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
 Phoebe:Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Okay then.
 Phoebe:But great news about the apartment pants huh?
 Phoebe:(crying) Yeah me too.
 Phoebe:Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
 Phoebe:All right what’s going on there? (Points to a picture.)
 Phoebe:Oh Chandler!
 Phoebe:So that story doesn’t make you cry?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi! (Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)
 Phoebe:You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. (The fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen take good care of that guy okay? (Points) He’s a fan. (To the fan as she’s leaving) Bye! (Exits)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey! What’s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
 Phoebe:It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
 Phoebe:(seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
 Phoebe:You’re making one right now!
 Phoebe:And-and you’re using my name!
 Phoebe:Look I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into the apartment) And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you (points to someone) with that! (Storms away.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:So I just came from the company Ursula works for.
 Phoebe:No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.
 Phoebe:Um-mmm and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
 Phoebe:Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
 Phoebe:Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where he’s seen her before.) (To him) You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To Joey) See?
 Phoebe:Wow!
 Phoebe:No! Barry and Mindy.
 Phoebe:Which time?
 Phoebe:What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
 Phoebe:Yeah I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
 Phoebe:Because at that time you see I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks I’d have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Ohh that’s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0 it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No it’s okay. It’s okay you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding you are of course fired.
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Who’s this? (Listens) Oh okay you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? (Listens) What kind of name is Brendy? I… Whatever… Stop talking! All right from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
 Phoebe:(yelling from Monica’s room) No-no!! No!!
 Phoebe:No! There-there was a little a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
 Phoebe:What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great now my chest hearts.
 Phoebe:(louder) My chest hurts! Oh and now I-I can’t breathe.
 Phoebe:Oh if I were would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
 Phoebe:Then yes that is what I’m having. (Takes another puff of the cigarette.)
 Phoebe:Most people don’t like their jobs I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.
 Phoebe:(To Ross) So what’s going on with you?
 Phoebe:Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
 Phoebe:How long has it been since you had sex?
 Phoebe:Oh that’s not so bad.
 Phoebe:That is.
 Phoebe:Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
 Phoebe:I don’t know. You could tie her up she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…
 Phoebe:Y’know dirty talk m�nage � trois toys…
 Phoebe:Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
 Phoebe:Yeah! Or too you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
 Phoebe:No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
 Phoebe:Okay! Okay! (Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I’m so glad you’re here.
 Phoebe:Oh give it to me.
 Phoebe:Give it!
 Phoebe:Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
 Phoebe:Thank God.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Well I’ve got to get out of this bed I’m going crazy here. Crazy!
 Phoebe:What the hell is this herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
 Phoebe:What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
 Phoebe:Okay what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! (Points at Ross.)
 Phoebe:I know! But if I didn’t work there what else would I do?
 Phoebe:Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
 Phoebe:Hmm pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh what do I do?! What will I do?!
 Phoebe:I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.
 Phoebe:No. I’ve learned my lesson.
 Phoebe:Let’s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old man who’s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.) Thanks Lou good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)
 Phoebe:Surprise! Look who’s back!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Uh I don’t think so!
 Phoebe:Jack!! Hey!
 Phoebe:All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research huh?
 Phoebe:Nu-uh!
 Phoebe:Oh okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway I’ll be in my office.
 Phoebe:That’s all right I’ll work here. This is goo next to this plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
 Phoebe:You’re in my office! Look I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…
 Phoebe:Oh so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh you have got to be kidding!
 Phoebe:I’m having another heart attack!
 Phoebe:I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
 Phoebe:(to Arthur he’s the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!
 Phoebe:Well they fired me and I’m having heart attack.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:(singing)
 Phoebe:Or y’know I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it) goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
 Phoebe:Now we can kick anybody’s ass!
 Phoebe:Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!
 Phoebe:(deadpan) Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.
 Phoebe:You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:Ooh Joey that’s actually a really good idea!
 Phoebe:You guys!
 Phoebe:Oh I love paper mache! What did you make?
 Phoebe:What is that?
 Phoebe:Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She takes out a sock that’s been made into a bunny with eyes nose mouth whiskers and two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!
 Phoebe:Now it’s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel’s face and they both laugh.)
 Phoebe:Ross!!!
 Phoebe:Ohh you’re a freak!!
 Phoebe:Pat Sajak?
 Phoebe:Alex Trebek?
 Phoebe:Chuck Woolery?
 Phoebe:Say we are unagi!
 Phoebe:(stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!
 Phoebe:Why is Ross doing that?
 Phoebe:We should help him!
 Phoebe:What’s a Movement class?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! How bad was it?
 Phoebe:Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Oh it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
 Phoebe:No not usually. But yeah I could use one right now.
 Phoebe:Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
 Phoebe:Well since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should get to stay here.
 Phoebe:Well no it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
 Phoebe:What’s that smell?
 Phoebe:So did you sleep well last night?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?
 Phoebe:Gum!
 Phoebe:Yeah I know it was my candle. My candle!
 Phoebe:I don’t use a curling iron.
 Phoebe:Thanks Monica!
 Phoebe:What the smell from Joey’s? No I can hardly smell it over here.
 Phoebe:I can smell it a little bake the pie.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens) Really?!
 Phoebe:Well not much has changed in the last five minutes.
 Phoebe:Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Reaches for one.)
 Phoebe:(gritting her teeth) Okay I’ll be out in a second.
 Phoebe:That doesn’t lock does it?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey! Hi!
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Listen umm yeah okay I need to talk to you!
 Phoebe:Now I know that they said that the umm the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see I didn’t I didn’t tell you but umm but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.
 Phoebe:Okay. Oh umm Chandler Monica is looking for you.
 Phoebe:Yeah she said something about crumbies.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Okay you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
 Phoebe:No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
 Phoebe:All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet paper towels.)
 Phoebe:God what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)
 Phoebe:Well what kind of guy are you looking for?
 Phoebe:Y’know this is probably none of my business but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
 Phoebe:Oh sly.
 Phoebe:(interrupting) Okay I got a good one. Okay umm what is she? Like 12?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Okay I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
 Phoebe:Oh that’s good I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
 Phoebe:‘Cause that’s just your taste.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah?
 Phoebe:My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And he has one of these (She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)
 Phoebe:A chin dimple!
 Phoebe:Have you seen your guy’s body?
 Phoebe:Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm when he was on the table I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah like there are police for that!
 Phoebe:I know. (Laughs.)
 Phoebe:Oh Chandler funny?
 Phoebe:My guy is well read.
 Phoebe:My guy has great teeth!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:What did you do on yours?
 Phoebe:Rachel what the hell is this?!
 Phoebe:You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
 Phoebe:Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
 Phoebe:So Sebastian do you do any volunteer work?
 Phoebe:No reason it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
 Phoebe:Well so do a lot of people.
 Phoebe:Yeah y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? Hey Sebastian would you like to dance? (Imitates him.) Uhh okay—I gotta go!
 Phoebe:Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.
 Phoebe:Okay sure!
 Phoebe:Ooh technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Ross you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.
 Phoebe:Nothing you just have to be cool with it.
 Phoebe:This is Patrick. (Points to him.)
 Phoebe:(looks) Oh my God you’re right! I am too late; they’re sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.) Rachel?
 Phoebe:This is Patrick.
 Phoebe:Yeah this is the guy I was telling you about.
 Phoebe:Yeah. And believe me this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Oh! Okay! Yeah that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)
 Phoebe:Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay let’s talk it out.
 Phoebe:Then why did she ask us to…
 Phoebe:Rachel we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.
 Phoebe:Oh my God look! That’s Elizabeth!
 Phoebe:You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
 Phoebe:Don’t worry about me I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!
 Phoebe:(she stops reading from the script) Oh my God.
 Phoebe:I am extremely talented!
 Phoebe:(interrupting) No I mean I was really acting my ass off.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah you’re solid. Yeah you’re just no me.
 Phoebe:(tremendously overacting) Fine! I’ll do it without you! (Joey gives her thumbs up) I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! (Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You’ll see!! You’ll all see!!
 Phoebe:I am.
 Phoebe:(overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
 Phoebe: Well he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... (The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his hands up Phoebes legs and grabbing her butt.)
 Phoebe: And all of the sudden his hands werent the problem anymore. (The flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)
 Phoebe: Oh Boy Scouts couldve camped under it!
 Phoebe: Its not that bad.
 Phoebe: Chandler Chandler.
 Phoebe:Oh!  All right.  Now lets not do this!
 Phoebe:Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
 Phoebe:OK now Im gonna kick some ass.
 Phoebe:I know!  I know!  I know!
 Phoebe:Alright now I will let go if you both stop.
 Phoebe:There we go.You know what if we were in prison you guys would be like my bitches.
 Phoebe:(overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!
 Phoebe:I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like Ooh where’d Ross go?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:(To Ross) He’s holding us back.
 Phoebe:No! Joey you’re going to be great!
 Phoebe:(in a sexy voice to Chandler) I’ll be waiting.
 Phoebe:No I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start writing another book!
 Phoebe:Well if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
 Phoebe:Oh Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
 Phoebe:I want to see what he wants first.
 Phoebe:You’re Elizabeth’s father huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
 Phoebe:(writing frantically) You guys I’m sorry could you please talk a little slower?
 Phoebe:Yeah it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps the pitfalls what not to do keep going. This stuff is great!
 Phoebe:And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. (Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well why don’t you just get him fired?
 Phoebe:(writing in her book) You wish.
 Phoebe:I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.
 Phoebe:Marcia and Chester.
 Phoebe:I see what you’re doing!
 Phoebe:Ooh I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
 Phoebe:(Turning around in the chair) Hi!
 Phoebe:I know what time you said.
 Phoebe:Well actually I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
 Phoebe:Quite an interesting turn of events suddenly it’s my book to the rescue huh? (Reading her book) Ooh very interesting. Yeah well this certainly clears things up.
 Phoebe:I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
 Phoebe:Thanks! So are you.
 Phoebe:(reading from her book) Mon… (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six Chester thinks it’s at seven.
 Phoebe:That’s right.
 Phoebe:(writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
 Phoebe:(dejected) Hi you guys.
 Phoebe:Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
 Phoebe:No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
 Phoebe:Okay that’s so generous!
 Phoebe:Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
 Phoebe:Oh this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
 Phoebe:(gasps) Ohh okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we’d be great together!
 Phoebe:So umm now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?
 Phoebe:Hey and then lunch.
 Phoebe:Oh wow. What do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?
 Phoebe:No reason! That would just be a really big surprise right?
 Phoebe:Yeah but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else y’know? Someone someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)
 Phoebe:Me too!
 Phoebe:I don’t know I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?
 Phoebe:Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.
 Phoebe:Don’t even get me started on yours!
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:No! Why?
 Phoebe:Well for the regular guy it’s bad but Chandler Oh dear God!
 Phoebe:What are you gonna do?
 Phoebe:Rachel said that!
 Phoebe:Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh Joey! Why did you sign it Son of a bitch? (Son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)
 Phoebe:Okay maybe ask this guy.
 Phoebe:Well what did he do?
 Phoebe:Joey!
 Phoebe:Well we should go.
 Phoebe:(entering from her room) Hey did she buy it?
 Phoebe:So did Heldi show you the place?
 Phoebe:I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
 Phoebe:Now have you told anyone else?
 Phoebe:You told me.
 Phoebe:Yeah well once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.
 Phoebe:Hey! So Chandler wanna go to the coffeehouse?
 Phoebe:Yeah coffeehouse.
 Phoebe:So how are things going with Paul?
 Phoebe:That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.
 Phoebe:No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Watch this.
 Phoebe:Hi Paul!
 Phoebe:So how are things going with you?
 Phoebe:Yeah! That was so weird huh?
 Phoebe:I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!
 Phoebe:Please I think you know why.
 Phoebe:Come on Ross you’re a paleontologist dig a little deeper.
 Phoebe:Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?
 Phoebe:Well then I think that’s it.
 Phoebe:Oh if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
 Phoebe:Okay so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
 Phoebe:Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
 Phoebe:(coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute no this is this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
 Phoebe:Or not whatever.
 Phoebe:Chandler I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?
 Phoebe:We will give you $10.
 Phoebe:We stand firm at $10.
 Phoebe:Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
 Phoebe:I’ll give you $1 for them.
 Phoebe:Okay umm I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think too much?
 Phoebe:Okay. Then take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh let me see the ring my friend picked out.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!! (She runs after him but sets of the security system which locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her caging her in.) No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)
 Phoebe:Chandler I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)
 Phoebe:Oh my God Chandler the one you picked is gone. It’s over!
 Phoebe:Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!
 Phoebe:The little jail between the doors!
 Phoebe:I know I’m sorry! But y’know this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
 Phoebe:Maybe it was the guy.
 Phoebe:(entering from her room) Hey.
 Phoebe:It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!
 Phoebe:Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
 Phoebe:Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.
 Phoebe:There he is! (Points.)
 Phoebe:Wow! You’re good! After this we should solve crimes.
 Phoebe:Oh okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
 Phoebe:It is your office.
 Phoebe:John?
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) Here he is.
 Phoebe:Wow! I would trade.
 Phoebe:Yeah do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?
 Phoebe:Yes and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…
 Phoebe:(entering) Hi.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh I know I helped pick out the ring.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:If she says no can I have the ring?
 Phoebe:If!
 Phoebe:(with her mouthful) Hi Monica.
 Phoebe:It’s gone.
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) We’re practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and winks at him.)
 Phoebe:Open bar?
 Phoebe:I can do that for the kids.
 Phoebe:Y’know you are 12 years older than her.
 Phoebe:Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)
 Phoebe:Here.
 Phoebe:So now what’s going on here?
 Phoebe:No I know what a silent is I meant what’s going on with your hair?
 Phoebe:No! It’s nice!
 Phoebe:Oh hi. (They shake hands.)
 Phoebe:Hey you guys! Look!
 Phoebe:I got me some drinks!
 Phoebe:Open bar!
 Phoebe:You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you?
 Phoebe:Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.]
 Phoebe:Well just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way through her tray of booze.)
 Phoebe:I’m just helping the kids!
 Phoebe:Because the more I drink the less there is for the kids to drink.
 Phoebe:Oh okay.
 Phoebe:It’s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she’s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.) Excuse me is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
 Phoebe:Oh en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it but he only shakes it.)
 Phoebe:Ohh let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)
 Phoebe:I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
 Phoebe:Eww! Oh it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.
 Phoebe:What happened?
 Phoebe:Well a palm reader a manicurist a hand doctor…
 Phoebe:Good one! Yeah.
 Phoebe:Look she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure so just throw her off the track.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!
 Phoebe:No you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
 Phoebe:I know they’re gonna be so happy together.
 Phoebe:Not that often!
 Phoebe:Me too! So happy for them!
 Phoebe:Oh no! No God definitely not jealous!
 Phoebe:Totally. I’m like 90/10.
 Phoebe:Definitely!
 Phoebe:What do you mean?
 Phoebe:You mean a backup?
 Phoebe:Yeah yeah I got that.
 Phoebe:Hm-mmm.
 Phoebe:Joey.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Yeah I locked him years ago!
 Phoebe:Yep we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
 Phoebe:Ohh yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
 Phoebe:Well hey it’s just a backup.
 Phoebe:Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look I’ve already lost Chandler!
 Phoebe:I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
 Phoebe:Okay this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!
 Phoebe:All right well let’s see Ross is a good father but Joey has a boat—This is hard!
 Phoebe:No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions okay? Just remember my promise when we get married three times a week.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) I’m talking about massages.
 Phoebe:Good!
 Phoebe:Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.
 Phoebe:(reading) Ross!
 Phoebe:Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)
 Phoebe:Oh no wait no this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!
 Phoebe:Oh no let her stay out there. It’s sweet.
 Phoebe:So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because y’know I’m kinda musical.
 Phoebe:Well speaking of chiming in remember the time you burned down my apartment?
 Phoebe:Oh 19! We thought you said 90!
 Phoebe:Oh honey no you ate it all.
 Phoebe:Check it out. Okay I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)
 Phoebe:If you would’ve let me finish it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.
 Phoebe:I’m sorry but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)
 Phoebe:Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.
 Phoebe:Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
 Phoebe:You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
 Phoebe:What a great night Chandler can’t do it these guys kissed… (Points to Ross and Rachel.)
 Phoebe:Well yeah that and Chandler’s problem.
 Phoebe:Okay so The Plaza! Okay we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.
 Phoebe:Why?!
 Phoebe:(she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay I think I’ll play it at the wedding.
 Phoebe:Well I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.
 Phoebe:Would she?
 Phoebe:Okay you said I could sing at your wedding so I’m just gonna need a small deposit.
 Phoebe:Y’know just some good faith money to hold the date.
 Phoebe:Oh I see. (Exits angrily.)
 Phoebe:Y’know I don’t really their permission.
 Phoebe:Yeah! And if you wanna look 19 then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.
 Phoebe:They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
 Phoebe:Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
 Phoebe:(singing angrily)
 Phoebe:(singing)
 Phoebe:Oh thank you.
 Phoebe:Now… (Starts singing again) Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer—(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the door behind him)—Oh—oh! All right I’ll pound on him in the morning.
 Phoebe:It starts?
 Phoebe:That is so smart! (To Chandler under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.
 Phoebe:Hey! Ross!
 Phoebe:I need to talk to you it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.
 Phoebe:Well umm not much. But I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy y’know? So could I just move in with you for a couple days?
 Phoebe:Nothing—Why?!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
 Phoebe:(to the students) Oh I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
 Phoebe:Oh Ross hi.
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I’m with a client right now.
 Phoebe:Okay let’s talk outside.
 Phoebe:What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!
 Phoebe:(pause as she considers it) Okay well Ross what is this really about?
 Phoebe:Okay I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!
 Phoebe:(gasps) My God! What did you order?!
 Phoebe:Look why don’t you just pay for it yourself?
 Phoebe:(reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello Mr. Chandler.
 Phoebe:Wow money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
 Phoebe:(entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
 Phoebe:My massage client Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
 Phoebe:He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
 Phoebe:Well he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
 Phoebe:Oh it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
 Phoebe:So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
 Phoebe:Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
 Phoebe:You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
 Phoebe:You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
 Phoebe:Break my heart—Oh all right.
 Phoebe:If you don’t sail your boat what do you do on it?
 Phoebe:Your own boat?
 Phoebe:I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
 Phoebe:(pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
 Phoebe:Okay here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)
 Phoebe:See no-no I made a batch and I froze it and this is the only one left.
 Phoebe:Why not?
 Phoebe:Really?!
 Phoebe:You do?
 Phoebe:That and arrogance.
 Phoebe:I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
 Phoebe:Come on it’s not that big a deal!
 Phoebe:Oh what was that for? Like a bake sale?
 Phoebe:Yeah but not as good as batch 17.
 Phoebe:Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.
 Phoebe:Y’know I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah—No she was really nice to me but she’s in hell for sure.
 Phoebe:Oh no-no no I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th 2032.
 Phoebe:That’s what you think.
 Phoebe:Well y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother Nesele Tolouse.
 Phoebe:Nesele Toulouse.
 Phoebe:Oh you Americans always butcher the French language.
 Phoebe:(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.
 Phoebe:I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) you’re burning in hell!!
 Phoebe:I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh yeah that’s right.
 Phoebe:What? You mean behind my back?
 Phoebe:(gasps) Oh God!
 Phoebe:Oh hey!
 Phoebe:(To Monica) Anyway I should go. Okay bye.
 Phoebe:Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute you hire them because they’re qualified.
 Phoebe:Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him because that—it’s not professional. Umm this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)
 Phoebe:Hey—Ooh how’s Hilda? Is she working out?
 Phoebe:Sorry.
 Phoebe:What happened?
 Phoebe:You! An actor?! That’s madness!
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:You must be Hilda.
 Phoebe:Oh you like that? You should hear my phone number.
 Phoebe:So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
 Phoebe:But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
 Phoebe:Oh Willie’s still alive!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.
 Phoebe:Hey why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.
 Phoebe:Yeah that’s great! Next to that Chandler won’t look so stupid.
 Phoebe:(returning) Hey you guys Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
 Phoebe:He is! But he’s getting divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.
 Phoebe:You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!
 Phoebe:So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?
 Phoebe:I’m having a really good time!
 Phoebe:Ohh. No that’s okay he’s a friend.
 Phoebe:Yeah I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals so I’d just be lost.
 Phoebe:Okay don’t freak out. I’ll go.
 Phoebe:Okay I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?
 Phoebe:Yeah umm that’s Whitney (Points) Kyle’s ex-wife out there now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?
 Phoebe:Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)
 Phoebe:Hi Ginger.
 Phoebe:I don’t have it!
 Phoebe:Ugh okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)
 Phoebe:All right well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle’s ex.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:(To Ross) Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
 Phoebe:Watching ballroom dancing?
 Phoebe:Well look-look okay Ross Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
 Phoebe:Like she’s really mean and she’s over critical and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
 Phoebe:And! She uses sex as a weapon!
 Phoebe:You’re still gonna go out with her?!
 Phoebe:Well didn’t you just hear what I said?!
 Phoebe:(interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!
 Phoebe:You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:So how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
 Phoebe:Yeah well maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
 Phoebe:You think he’s emotionally unavailable?
 Phoebe:Well maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!
 Phoebe:Yeah well she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.
 Phoebe:(gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!
 Phoebe:Oh I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed how’s Whitney?
 Phoebe:Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.
 Phoebe:Both of you together?
 Phoebe:What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
 Phoebe:Oh right because you’re so capable of change.
 Phoebe:Yeah and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.
 Phoebe:Oh. Y’know he hums while he does other stuff to.
 Phoebe:And y’know even if they break up again you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!
 Phoebe:Potato Potaato. (She’s pronounces potato with the both the short and long As.)
 Phoebe:Ooh let’s see it!
 Phoebe:You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)
 Phoebe:I hope it’s you.
 Phoebe:Yes!!! Oh!!
 Phoebe:Still.
 Phoebe:Yeah I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?
 Phoebe:Wh-why is that the best part?
 Phoebe:Aww and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
 Phoebe:Hey Rachel?
 Phoebe:Umm when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm.
 Phoebe:Oh! Well if that’s what you want…
 Phoebe:But why does it even matter?!
 Phoebe:Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!
 Phoebe:(gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look Rachel I know you really want to do this but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!
 Phoebe:And no oh please oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.
 Phoebe:Oh thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.
 Phoebe:Oh I know.
 Phoebe:See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!
 Phoebe:Na-uh I am!
 Phoebe:Because I cared enough to lie!
 Phoebe:What are you talking about?
 Phoebe:Okay so after this audition who decides who gets it?
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Well it’s better than us deciding.
 Phoebe:No! Coins hate me!
 Phoebe:Hey there you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
 Phoebe:Ugh what a kiss ass.
 Phoebe:Yes! Your honor?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
 Phoebe:Okay I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)
 Phoebe:Really?! I won!
 Phoebe:The coins have finally forgiven me!
 Phoebe:(running after her) Rach it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:That’s ridiculous Rachel we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh you mean today.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah!
 Phoebe:Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
 Phoebe:Ohh.
 Phoebe:This stuff is great!
 Phoebe:Y’know Rach I think that I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.
 Phoebe:Because I think it means more to you.
 Phoebe:Its fine. I mean this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)
 Phoebe:(looking at the picture again) Man alive!
 Phoebe:Well we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
 Phoebe:Okay!
 Phoebe:And call me!
 Phoebe:We want you to marry her!
 Phoebe:She is so amazing! You have no idea.
 Phoebe:Joey she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.
 Phoebe:Yeah but you always say that.
 Phoebe:Whatever.
 Phoebe:Secret affair!
 Phoebe:(entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh no.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yay!! Oh so you’re not you’re not mad at us anymore?
 Phoebe:Didn’t you sleep together?
 Phoebe:Then change it back!
 Phoebe:No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?
 Phoebe:Does Joey have any idea?
 Phoebe:Yeah you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.
 Phoebe:Yeah and maybe that you’re a real (She says something in Italian and it doesn’t matter what she said. It’s not important so I don’t need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)
 Phoebe:Oh well I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.
 Phoebe:No just a regular old flying dwarf.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:So how was how was your date?
 Phoebe:Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
 Phoebe:Hey Joey y’know what? You are way to good for her.
 Phoebe:Oh I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery and I have one regular celery.
 Phoebe:Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)
 Phoebe:Hey you guys Im gonna go out and take a walk.
 Phoebe:Oh its not!
 Phoebe:Its just my knitting thats all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebes bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. Im very good.
 Phoebe:(answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
 Phoebe:Im sorry whos this?
 Phoebe:No theres no dog here?
 Phoebe:Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
 Phoebe:(Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) Theyre here already? How are they doing this?
 Phoebe:Theres no dog in here.
 Phoebe:No thats just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh good there you are! Listen um I have a dog in my room.
 Phoebe:Well Im watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down picks up the dog and waves with one of its paws) Hello my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
 Phoebe:Thats odd cause this dogs been living here for the past 3 days
 Phoebe:Are you crazy?
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:You dont like ice cream?
 Phoebe:All right. Were gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. Well be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)
 Phoebe:Oh Id say about a month.
 Phoebe:(doing Clunkers) Please dont leave me Ill be lonely.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay.
 Phoebe:You know if you want we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldnt even know.
 Phoebe:Ive had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. Hes not so smart.
 Phoebe:Yeah but you kinda knew that something was going on didnt you?
 Phoebe:Wheres Chandler?
 Phoebe:Wash your hands!!!
 Phoebe:(interrupts him) No no we dont really have time for this right now. Okay we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
 Phoebe:See this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)
 Phoebe:(opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey is Chandler here?
 Phoebe:Okay but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
 Phoebe:Oh no the dogs not going to be there!
 Phoebe:(interrupts her to Monica) Shh wait and see. Maybe we will maybe we wont.
 Phoebe:We have good news look whose back!
 Phoebe:Its a Thanksgiving miracle!
 Phoebe:Yeah she came all the way back from Ross building. Oh the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went to far didnt I? When should I have stopped?
 Phoebe:His first big kid’s bike this is so exciting!
 Phoebe:I never had a bike of my own.
 Phoebe:Well we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips and-and-and a bell and this big white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
 Phoebe:No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. (They’re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
 Phoebe:Not really I got to drag him around too! (They all nod Oh.)
 Phoebe:Yeah and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:(gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
 Phoebe:I love it!!
 Phoebe:Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
 Phoebe:Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
 Phoebe:Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten.
 Phoebe:(starts to leave but stops) Oh and Chandler’s about to cry.
 Phoebe:Oh hi!
 Phoebe:Ohh uh-huh so much!
 Phoebe:Of course!
 Phoebe:Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack gets on pushes off rolls a few feet and falls over.) See?
 Phoebe:(hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!
 Phoebe:Why? Why do I have to learn?
 Phoebe:What kind of an emergency?
 Phoebe:Okay I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
 Phoebe:You won’t let go?
 Phoebe:Swear?!
 Phoebe:(thinks it over) Okay.
 Phoebe:All right.
 Phoebe:Well…
 Phoebe:Okay. (Does so.)
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
 Phoebe:Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
 Phoebe:I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)
 Phoebe:(seeing him) Oh hello liar.
 Phoebe:I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
 Phoebe:Well I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)
 Phoebe:What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
 Phoebe:What?! Why?!
 Phoebe:All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap okay.
 Phoebe:(sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) Please don’t die!
 Phoebe:I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
 Phoebe:Don’t be so corny Ross it’s not an after-school special. (She rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny silver training wheels firmly attached.)
 Phoebe:(entering carrying a skull) Hey!
 Phoebe:Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
 Phoebe:Huh?
 Phoebe:Oh yeah its my moms.
 Phoebe:No no no. Its not! Its not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah no she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us that even though its Christmas people still die. And you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull pulls out a stick of licorice and takes a bite.)
 Phoebe:And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
 Phoebe:(entering) Oh hey you guys!
 Phoebe:Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon so I guess Ill be moving out.
 Phoebe:Yes you will be very sad. All right well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
 Phoebe:Yeah why not?
 Phoebe:Why do you think shes having so much fun living with Joey?
 Phoebe:Really? So she said she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?
 Phoebe:Youre sure? Youre absolutely sure?
 Phoebe:Probably? Yeah I dont like that word. (Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah uh-huh. Yeah oh Your mom probably wont kill herself y’know? Im sorry but Im not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on Probably! Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
 Phoebe:So you like the drums! Thats thats great! Y’know I was worried that you know they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right okay well apparently not! So yay!
 Phoebe:Thats fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey! (she sits down next to him)
 Phoebe:Yes thank you. You see this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
 Phoebe:Maybe on some level.
 Phoebe:(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey Joey I got you another present. (She puts it on the counter)
 Phoebe:Its a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel look Im sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big gross scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
 Phoebe:(sarcastic) Ah yeah hes so adorable God hes just so much fun Joey is the best Im glad youre having so much fun here. (She turns around about to leave)
 Phoebe:Our apartment is ready.
 Phoebe:Because you would rather live here with Joey.
 Phoebe:Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
 Phoebe:Hm?
 Phoebe:(nods along) Fish!
 Phoebe:Yes but I wanted you to want to live with me but okay if youre having so much fun over here…
 Phoebe:We did have fun didnt we?
 Phoebe:Oh anyway they say if we want we can see it tonight.
 Phoebe:Yay okay!
 Phoebe:Great all right okay and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
 Phoebe:Oh this is terrible. Oh they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!
 Phoebe:Well I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.
 Phoebe:There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) Wow!!
 Phoebe:(returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
 Phoebe:A little bit yeah.
 Phoebe:You heard her too?! You have the gift!
 Phoebe:Are you sure?
 Phoebe:Oh me too.
 Phoebe:No I do not hear that.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Okay I understand why Superman is here but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?
 Phoebe:(entering carrying a skull) Hey!
 Phoebe:Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
 Phoebe:Huh?
 Phoebe:Oh yeah its my moms.
 Phoebe:No no no. Its not! Its not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah no she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us that even though its Christmas people still die. And you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull pulls out a stick of licorice and takes a bite.)

 Phoebe:Okay I understand why Superman is here but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?
 Phoebe:(looking up) There it is! Oh look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature amazing?
 Phoebe:Well all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high that’s pretty amazing too.
 Phoebe:Oh! I won’t say ‘no’ to a movie!
 Phoebe:Shh! Get me out of here.
 Phoebe:(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and finds that it’s the smoke detector that’s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off in frustration she yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed just as she gets there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery but it still beeps.) How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…
 Phoebe:Don’t interrupt me!!
 Phoebe:Okay. So this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (She points at each as she says it.) Okay so to get the beeping to stop all I have to do… (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up and heads to bed stops quickly turns around and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) Well done Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed but is stopped at the entrance to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
 Phoebe:Okay this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the chute.) Noisy bitch!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
 Phoebe:(scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi officer—fireman can-can I help you?
 Phoebe:That’s not mine.
 Phoebe:How do you know?
 Phoebe:Okay do you—Okay do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
 Phoebe:Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
 Phoebe:There’s a reset button?! Ugh thank you! Thank you! (He exits and she goes to shut it off.) There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that! (She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button reset button where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.) Oh! (She presses it hard but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh God!
 Phoebe:What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
 Phoebe:I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey.
 Phoebe:Ugh I hate this year!
 Phoebe:Well okay it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
 Phoebe:Oh that’s right!
 Phoebe:Yeah and yeah and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. (Monica and Ross are shocked.)
 Phoebe:Oh yeah like you never called!
 Phoebe:Okay I can do that! Oh by the way I love my office.
 Phoebe:Oh okay. Umm all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.) Hi this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies can I speak to your supply manager please?
 Phoebe:Umm okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
 Phoebe:Oh okay well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the phone.) Yeah you’re right this is easy.
 Phoebe:Oh well all right…um no offense but you were kind of rude.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do I do have one question. What is toner?
 Phoebe:(on phone) Hi this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies can I speak to your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She’s reading from the script.)
 Phoebe:I’m hearing what you’re saying but at our prices everyone needs toner.
 Phoebe:May I ask why?
 Phoebe:I surely do!
 Phoebe:(doesn’t have any luck) Umm is-is that because you’re out of toner?
 Phoebe:No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Now why do you want to kill yourself?
 Phoebe:Chandler?
 Phoebe:No look I-I’m sure that people know you exist!
 Phoebe:Earl you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her coworkers overhears that and she mimes that she didn’t mean him.)
 Phoebe:Wait what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
 Phoebe:All right so Earl let’s just forget about the people at the office okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family your friends or maybe your girlfriend?
 Phoebe:Oh sorry boyfriend!
 Phoebe:No whatever! Anything!
 Phoebe:Yeah he’s gotta go.
 Phoebe:No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!
 Phoebe:(to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.
 Phoebe:(goes over to his desk) Earl! I’m Phoebe.
 Phoebe:Umm look it you-you can’t kill yourself.
 Phoebe:No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!
 Phoebe:Because it was fate that made me call you today!
 Phoebe:No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
 Phoebe:Yes.
 Phoebe:I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
 Phoebe:No it’s fate!
 Phoebe:Oh. Well umm okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this okay? Your-your name is Earl right? Her name was Pearl P-Earl.
 Phoebe:Sure! (Thinks.) Umm where are you from?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! So was she! Oh I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps. (She holds out her arm.)
 Phoebe:Well y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.
 Phoebe:But if—no look okay. These jerks might not care about you but the universe does! And that says a lot!
 Phoebe:Y’know I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no it’s you.
 Phoebe:Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
 Phoebe:Yeah but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.
 Phoebe:I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head into Central Perk Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)
 Phoebe:Oh well get in line missy. (To Ross) So can I have a ride stud?
 Phoebe:(getting out) Okay who’s next?
 Phoebe:Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.
 Phoebe:Least of all you.
 Phoebe:(running up) Okay. Okay here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right here we go. (She opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel. She inserts the device unlocks the door opens it and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!! (Runs off.)
 Phoebe:Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It’s for the child in you and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
 Phoebe:Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.
 Phoebe:Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
 Phoebe:Yeah. What?!
 Phoebe:Nu-uh!
 Phoebe:You have your birth certificate?
 Phoebe:Our mom.
 Phoebe:Do you have my birth certificate?
 Phoebe:(reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God we are 31.
 Phoebe:I just lost a whole year of my life.
 Phoebe:Your middle name is Pamela?
 Phoebe:Well I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
 Phoebe:That’s my first name.
 Phoebe:Hey what’s going on?
 Phoebe:Yay! I love drunk Monica!
 Phoebe:Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.
 Phoebe:Oh let me guess and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
 Phoebe:If you could do that I’d marry the hippity-hop.
 Phoebe:(clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
 Phoebe:Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!
 Phoebe:(screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Okay quick help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)
 Phoebe:I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!
 Phoebe:Will it? Will it?! I mean how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
 Phoebe:Plus it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
 Phoebe:Like okay I-I-I I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!
 Phoebe:No I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)
 Phoebe:Oh yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)
 Phoebe:You did the right thing.
 Phoebe:(Clears Throat) Rach so that guy there. Straight or gay?
 Phoebe:Yeah? Why?
 Phoebe:Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
 Phoebe:(A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
 Phoebe:Ohh he left his cell phone.
 Phoebe:Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
 Phoebe:Yeah… That does sound great. Im going to get the phone. (They both get up.)
 Phoebe:I dont know. I havent been out on a date in so long.
 Phoebe:That wasn’t a date! That was that was just friends getting together…(quietly) having sex.
 Phoebe:No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
 Phoebe:Nice try.
 Phoebe:I don’t know.
 Phoebe:Ah-ha! Too cocky!
 Phoebe:Or we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
 Phoebe:(handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
 Phoebe:Ohh I lost my mom to suicide.
 Phoebe:Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
 Phoebe:Okay a meat eater. Fine that’s one for you.
 Phoebe:So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Good.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:Ooh now you lost me.
 Phoebe:No I didn’t!
 Phoebe:No.
 Phoebe:That is a different phone.
 Phoebe:That is damning evidence.
 Phoebe:(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes I’m the one who found your phone.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Shhh! I’m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah you can pick it up tonight say 830? At-at my apartment. It’s umm it’s umm 5 Morton Street Apartment 14 umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. (Listens) Okay well okay I’ll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)
 Phoebe:Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
 Phoebe:Oh. Okay well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
 Phoebe:What?! That’s the first time today!
 Phoebe:Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
 Phoebe:Because it’s my apartment!
 Phoebe:Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
 Phoebe:Could you-could you umm give us one second?
 Phoebe:Wh-what do we do?
 Phoebe:Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
 Phoebe:Hmm they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!
 Phoebe:Rachel listen—I mean if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
 Phoebe:Yeah! You’re such a great friend!
 Phoebe:Oh that’d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
 Phoebe:(whispering) Nice!
 Phoebe:Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
 Phoebe:(returning with Joey) With what?
 Phoebe:Oo! You should have one of us do it!
 Phoebe:No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
 Phoebe:Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!
 Phoebe:What?! No! It was my idea!
 Phoebe:Oh I have a headache. A horrible headache!
 Phoebe:Oh my God you’ve got to stop chattering!
 Phoebe:What is it?
 Phoebe:Oh no I don’t believe in Western medicine. No if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache so thanks. (Takes the pills.)
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
 Phoebe:Oh I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)
 Phoebe:Say what?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness nervousness drowsiness facial swelling nausea headache—Headache. Vomiting stomach bleeding liver damage! Now okay I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry extra strength death capsules!
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
 Phoebe:Okay then I must be disoriented.
 Phoebe:I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
 Phoebe:Oh interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! (Holds up the warning label.)
 Phoebe:Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
 Phoebe:Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
 Phoebe:Yeah it’s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
 Phoebe:(To Joey) What?!
 Phoebe:I know! Robin is so gay!
 Phoebe:I’m really glad you guys are okay but I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.
 Phoebe:(still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks her watch) That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
 Phoebe:Oh it’s like huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look (reads the side affects) no hair loss not a rash no hives I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath no temporary euphoria—Oh.
 Phoebe:Since when are you into swing music?
 Phoebe:What is your job?
 Phoebe:(wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but look at Monica!
 Phoebe:Ooh is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!
 Phoebe:Got it.
 Phoebe:(coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
 Phoebe:(hearing the signal) I’m coming! I’m coming! (She takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
 Phoebe:Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What are you doing? (Rachel doesn’t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won’t stop so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
 Phoebe:Did you find the dress?
 Phoebe:I—We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
 Phoebe:Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel’s hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (She’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
 Phoebe:I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:(gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
 Phoebe:Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
 Phoebe:Yeah swing music is so out.
 Phoebe:Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) I’m sorry too soon. You go.
 Phoebe:Good for you!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
 Phoebe:Go for it.
 Phoebe:I’m just saying get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
 Phoebe:I did but that was really fun.
 Phoebe:Oh hey!
 Phoebe:Oh great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)
 Phoebe:(laughs) All I could think of was y’know Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?
 Phoebe:I’m a lady Monica I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)
 Phoebe:I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.
 Phoebe:You sound like a guy.
 Phoebe:You’ll have a last kiss.
 Phoebe:Okay bye. (They kiss.)
 Phoebe:Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
 Phoebe:(yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
 Phoebe:No. Why?
 Phoebe:Okay don’t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. (Points to a guy sitting behind Monica.)
 Phoebe:No that is the last thing you want to do!
 Phoebe:Because you’re marrying him!
 Phoebe:All right I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship do not communicate them to your husband.
 Phoebe:That is correct! Yes you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
 Phoebe:Yes!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! You’re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love? (Monica is shocked.)
 Phoebe:Rach?
 Phoebe:Oh. (Picks it up.) It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…
 Phoebe:…in Reservations at 800 by Neil Simon. (To an imaginary Neil Simon) Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. (Blows him a kiss.)
 Phoebe:Please don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
 Phoebe:What are you doing?
 Phoebe:Oh! You got it?!
 Phoebe:The next next?
 Phoebe:What’s the matter?
 Phoebe:Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.
 Phoebe:Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
 Phoebe:Sure.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Well when can we have this shower?
 Phoebe:Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?
 Phoebe:Well if we make it yesterday woo-hoo! We’re done!
 Phoebe:Rachel calm down!
 Phoebe:(grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
 Phoebe:Oh okay. All right then I need to calm down a little.
 Phoebe:Uh here. What time?
 Phoebe:Finger sandwiches and tea.
 Phoebe:And chili!
 Phoebe:Both!
 Phoebe:Neither.
 Phoebe:Lusts of the flesh.
 Phoebe:I don’t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?
 Phoebe:Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.
 Phoebe:Okay. Okay! Well okay who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! (Holds it up.) We have a guest list!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of women.) Hi thanks for coming.
 Phoebe:Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to another pairing.) Oh it’s so nice to see you.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
 Phoebe:Who the hell are all these people?
 Phoebe:Hmm y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!
 Phoebe:You were supposed to tell her!
 Phoebe:Fine I’ll go call her.
 Phoebe:And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Well we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
 Phoebe:We ruined everything.
 Phoebe:Sur-surprise.
 Phoebe:Cassie are you finding everything okay in there?
 Phoebe:Oh! No problem! I… (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)
 Phoebe:(in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin!
 Phoebe:I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey’s like in Checkers.) Chess!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey oh Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
 Phoebe:What is this? What’s going on?
 Phoebe:Joey’s!
 Phoebe:(laughs) Yeah I’m sure that happened.
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
 Phoebe:Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey smiles and nods lewdly.)
 Phoebe:Okay it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:To Ross.
 Phoebe:Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.
 Phoebe:Of course! Yeah I was uh umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Y’know we were really huge too but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
 Phoebe:Really?!
 Phoebe:Oh somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.
 Phoebe:Rachel it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay if-if you say that you kissed Melissa then you kissed Melissa.
 Phoebe:I know.
 Phoebe:I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
 Phoebe:I’ve had better.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Yeah except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)
 Phoebe:Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
 Phoebe:Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like… (They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things you taught him.
 Phoebe:Oh look twins. Hi guys. Oh cute cute.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.
 Phoebe:Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
 Phoebe:Yeah you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?
 Phoebe:(looking out the window) Oh look! Theres Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each others clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
 Phoebe:(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
 Phoebe:CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
 Phoebe:OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
 Phoebe:NO! THEYRE DOING IT!!!
 Phoebe:YOU KNOW?!!!
 Phoebe:(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
 Phoebe:Okay so now they know that you know and they dont know that Rachel knows?
 Phoebe:Or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
 Phoebe:Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
 Phoebe:Ill have to get back to you on that. Okay bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
 Phoebe:No!
 Phoebe:God they thought they can mess with us! Theyre trying to mess with us?! They dont know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey you cant say anything!
 Phoebe:Hes not backing down. He went to get lotion.
 Phoebe:Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow you didn’t rip off any buttons.
 Phoebe:Umm not without you lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So this is my bra.
 Phoebe:You should be. Im very bendy. (Pause) Im gonna kiss you now.
 Phoebe:Ooh.
 Phoebe:Here it comes. Our first kiss.
 Phoebe:And why not?!
 Phoebe:Youre-youre what?!
 Phoebe:I just—I thought you guys were doing it I didnt know you were in love!
 Phoebe:Y’know you’re friend’s getting married it’s gotta change things.
 Phoebe:How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:(To Monica) Oh that’s beautiful.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay I drive it all the time.
 Phoebe:Okay I can fix this! Okay Monica Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)
 Phoebe:Ooh I think I wanna trade circles.
 Phoebe:Okay I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)
 Phoebe:Hey sweetie!
 Phoebe:Yeah! Sure! Ooh I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back. (She goes to get it.)
 Phoebe:What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh. (Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:I know. They were mine.
 Phoebe:No it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
 Phoebe:I’m wearing his briefs right now.
 Phoebe:I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
 Phoebe:And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
 Phoebe:There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.
 Phoebe:I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.
 Phoebe:Okay whatever.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Huh.
 Phoebe:That’s great Joe!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Hmm?
 Phoebe:I think it’s important that you do.
 Phoebe:Feel better?
 Phoebe:Yeah I understand.
 Phoebe:Why?! What’s happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.) Oh! (Realizes.)
 Phoebe:What are they?
 Phoebe:That play?
 Phoebe:The movie?
 Phoebe:Ohh!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah! Back then y’know we called the Great War. It really was!
 Phoebe:Congratulations!
 Phoebe:Go ahead.
 Phoebe:Yes! Very good.
 Phoebe:Ross please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)
 Phoebe:(walking up) What’s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) Tell Monica I’m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
 Phoebe:Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry.
 Phoebe:Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel’s apartment) right now?!
 Phoebe:(pointing at Ross) Okay but if you don’t find him and bring him back I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
 Phoebe:Oh man.
 Phoebe:Okay. Well there’s one down.
 Phoebe:Y’know she might not even notice he’s gone.
 Phoebe:Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can’t do this here! (She drags her into the bathroom.)
 Phoebe:Yeah but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!
 Phoebe:Yeah. (Looks.) Oh that’s gone too. This is Monica’s bathroom right?!
 Phoebe:No-no! I-I…I found one.
 Phoebe:(looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)
 Phoebe:Oh here’s a whole bunch.
 Phoebe:(finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!
 Phoebe:There was a pregnancy test in the garbage and it’s positive. Monica’s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won’t be totally alone.
 Phoebe:I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey can this count as her something new?
 Phoebe:Hey do you think this is why Chandler took off?
 Phoebe:Oh God this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this. (She throws the test back into the trash.)
 Phoebe:Right.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay. Hey wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
 Phoebe:Just for the future this is hardly a commercial for it.
 Phoebe:You told them he was missing?
 Phoebe:Okay. I’m going with you.
 Phoebe:Ross you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
 Phoebe:Okay. Wait do you know how you’re going to stall her?
 Phoebe:All right. Good luck.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)
 Phoebe:He could be in disguise y’know.
 Phoebe:What the hell are you doing?!
 Phoebe:Why not?!
 Phoebe:But look Chandler right now no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
 Phoebe:(entering) Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eye on it y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…
 Phoebe:So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
 Phoebe:Oh my God Monica!
 Phoebe:(To Rachel) Wait! Maybe maybe you’re overreacting! You do that y’know.
 Phoebe:Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Yeah!
 Phoebe:What’s going on?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
 Phoebe:Hey! Oh!
 Phoebe:You know?!
 Phoebe:What? You’ll hi-ya?
 Phoebe:Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey Mon why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?
 Phoebe:We found your test in the trash if you’re not pregnant—(She sees Rachel shaking her head)—It’s because I am.
 Phoebe:Yes I…I am with child. (Flash) And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder.
 Phoebe:I can’t say.
 Phoebe:I can’t say because he’s famous.
 Phoebe:Okay okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
 Phoebe:What?! Well he never said that to me!
 Phoebe:How about just the bridemaids?
 Phoebe:It is.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
 Phoebe:Sneaky.
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm.
 Phoebe:Oh I know. I could only think of two names him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.
 Phoebe:(intrigued) Really?!
 Phoebe:So are you ready to talk about it?
 Phoebe:Now?
 Phoebe:Okay we’ll talk about something else then.
 Phoebe:Who’s the father?!
 Phoebe:Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?
 Phoebe:Okay I’m sorry. I’ll stop.
 Phoebe:Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God it’s Joey!
 Phoebe:Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him.
 Phoebe:Well I just got off the phone with my lover James Brolin…
 Phoebe:Yes and apparently he is married to some singer but he said he would leave her for me. And I said James James Brolin are you sure? James Brolin said…
 Phoebe:(shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?
 Phoebe:Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.
 Phoebe:When I got pregnant with the triplets I took that test like three times just to make sure.
 Phoebe:I’m-I’m just saying don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.
 Phoebe:I’ll run out and get you one.
 Phoebe:Oh no she won’t tell us.
 Phoebe:See? This is why you register.
 Phoebe:30 seconds.
 Phoebe:It’s time.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Umm it’s negative.
 Phoebe:It’s negative.
 Phoebe:Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
 Phoebe:No it’s positive.
 Phoebe:It’s-it’s not negative it’s positive.
 Phoebe:Well yeah I lied before.
 Phoebe:Now you know how you really feel about it.
 Phoebe:With who?
 Phoebe:Oh! Joey uh were you in our room last night?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
 Phoebe:A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
 Phoebe:Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know it’s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)
 Phoebe:Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.
 Phoebe:Ooh is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
 Phoebe:What?! I think he’s cute.
 Phoebe:Believe me I’m trying.
 Phoebe:Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check or the raw sexual magnetism.
 Phoebe:Pretty big? It’s huge! God this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.
 Phoebe:Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!
 Phoebe:I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah. That’s me.
 Phoebe:Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God I’m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)
 Phoebe:You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like she’s pregnant.)
 Phoebe:David Lynn.
 Phoebe:Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
 Phoebe:Hey! Ooh did you do it yet?
 Phoebe:Oh well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it Gunther?
 Phoebe:Thank God ‘cause that hair on a baby…
 Phoebe:Why not?
 Phoebe:Bus?
 Phoebe:Well-well but it is huge.
 Phoebe:You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of…See?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey.
 Phoebe:All right. (She sits down like she’s pregnant again.)
 Phoebe:Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)
 Phoebe:Hey lady your day’s over! It’s my turn!
 Phoebe:I can and I will! (Kisses him.)
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:It’s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths ‘I love you’ to him.)
 Phoebe:We don’t know.
 Phoebe:Who? Who is it?
 Phoebe:Was that story over?
 Phoebe:(gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is… (She walks into Monica and Chandler’s.)
 Phoebe:Look I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
 Phoebe:I may play the fool at times but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
 Phoebe:Really? Are you sure?
 Phoebe:Okay sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)
 Phoebe:Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm I believe that this is your red sweater.
 Phoebe:Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)
 Phoebe:What?!!
 Phoebe:No!!
 Phoebe:I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
 Phoebe:Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
 Phoebe:Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
 Phoebe:Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
 Phoebe:It was his sweater but—Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Me too! (Joins the hug.)
 Phoebe:Yeah bye.
 Phoebe:Oh its so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
 Phoebe:All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
 Phoebe:What?! They took mine to give to you!
 Phoebe:Maybe they don’t trust us.
 Phoebe:You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?
 Phoebe:No you didn’t.
 Phoebe:Well what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
 Phoebe:What stuff?
 Phoebe:Did Rachel find you?
 Phoebe:Oh she was looking for you.
 Phoebe:Well she really wanted to talk to you now.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:(deadpan) And?
 Phoebe:Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!
 Phoebe:(To Joey) Maybe it’s something you ate?
 Phoebe:Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
 Phoebe:Well why don’t you use your key?
 Phoebe:Oh! We could have done that.
 Phoebe:Oh great! And listen could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
 Phoebe:Oh no.
 Phoebe:Didn’t you two already talk?
 Phoebe:(simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!
 Phoebe:That is brand new information!!
 Phoebe:A little bit.
 Phoebe:Oh Ross.
 Phoebe:Oh hey hi he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. (The chair breaks in half.) Okay we’re in. (She hangs up the phone.)
 Phoebe:Hey! So how was the doctor?
 Phoebe:Good.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Come on in!
 Phoebe:So how was the honeymoon?
 Phoebe:That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.
 Phoebe:Oh Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
 Phoebe:You have got to be kidding me!
 Phoebe:Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.
 Phoebe:I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!
 Phoebe:(nasally) Greg and Jenny?
 Phoebe:You got fake numbered.
 Phoebe:Excuse me I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.
 Phoebe:Hmm I wonder why. Pervert!
 Phoebe:That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand put your left hand down your pants and repeat that!
 Phoebe:Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)
 Phoebe:No! Not the sex part just the stuff leading up to it.
 Phoebe:Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who’ thing to rest! Come on now think!!
 Phoebe:You’re gonna get pregnant.
 Phoebe:Oh you came on to Ross!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Dinner was good!
 Phoebe:I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go!
 Phoebe:(To him) Oh well hello there.
 Phoebe:(To Monica) I didn’t see this on the menu.
 Phoebe:Oh so youre Monica’s boss?
 Phoebe:Oh! I sous stand.
 Phoebe:Oh you…you made pesto?
 Phoebe:Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
 Phoebe:I made it myself.
 Phoebe:Well it’s no pesto.
 Phoebe:Ooh Monica!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.
 Phoebe:But why?!
 Phoebe:Well maybe he was just nervous y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
 Phoebe:But Monica he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
 Phoebe:That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
 Phoebe:Love it!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:But…
 Phoebe:Okay. Okay but you can’t fire him today.
 Phoebe:Because I’m dumping him today.
 Phoebe:He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. (Mimicking him) So did-did you get home from work okay? Did-did you get out of the shower okay?
 Phoebe:Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) I’m so worried about you. Uck! Be a man!
 Phoebe:You can’t fire him and dump him the same day he’ll kill himself.
 Phoebe:Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip I’ll kill myself!
 Phoebe:Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
 Phoebe:Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired blond bitch!
 Phoebe:All right that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:It will be…in a minute. Listen Tim you’re a really great guy.
 Phoebe:Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…
 Phoebe:Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.
 Phoebe:Monica!
 Phoebe:(simultaneously) I’m breaking up with you!
 Phoebe:I’m I’m breaking up with you.
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.
 Phoebe:Oh that’s good the chemistry thing for us too.
 Phoebe:And Tim I just wanna say good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves which disgusts Monica.)
 Phoebe:Oh good! (And there’s general excitement.)
 Phoebe:Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
 Phoebe:Ursula! (Ursula turns smiles and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err it’s me! Phoebe!
 Phoebe:Wait a second! So what’s new with you?
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Huh. Okay. Well I’m really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:Yeah. Okay. Umm y’know my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.
 Phoebe:By the way it’s a costume party.
 Phoebe:(looks down) No. But thanks. (Walks away.)
 Phoebe:Ah Catwoman. So we meet again.
 Phoebe:No it’s me. Phoebe!
 Phoebe:(To Chandler) That is so you!
 Phoebe:No wonder your pregnant.
 Phoebe:Okay I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
 Phoebe:Ursula’s fianc�e?
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:My mother killed herself.
 Phoebe:No-no! That’s okay we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.
 Phoebe:Why are you looking at me like that?
 Phoebe:Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So what are you?
 Phoebe:(laughs) No I-I meant your costume.
 Phoebe:I love the second grade!
 Phoebe:Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.
 Phoebe:Umm I’m a masseuse…by day. (Stands with her hands on her hips like a Supergirl pose.)
 Phoebe:No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.
 Phoebe:Thank you.
 Phoebe:(walking over) Hey. Ursula’s fianc�e is really sweet! He’s a teacher he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:No I’m not! You are!
 Phoebe:Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
 Phoebe:Two weeks? That’s it?
 Phoebe:Oh really?
 Phoebe:Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)
 Phoebe:Peace Corps really? (Ursula motions I don’t know.)
 Phoebe:Hi liar!
 Phoebe:Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
 Phoebe:But they’re not!
 Phoebe:Why are you lying to him?
 Phoebe:You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
 Phoebe:Hmm?
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Sure it does. Yeah yeah.
 Phoebe:Umm listen I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
 Phoebe:Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.
 Phoebe:She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs Ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. (Holds up her nametag.) Okay here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher a waitress. All right here’s her driver license this oughta be good she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
 Phoebe:Oh I almost don’t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just remember I’m a minute younger.
 Phoebe:No. You’re not you’re not stupid.
 Phoebe:That’s good you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?
 Phoebe:Yeah you should. (They shake hands.)
 Phoebe:(looking around) Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.
 Phoebe:(checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?
 Phoebe:Oh my God Eric hi! Wait how’d you get this number?
 Phoebe:Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.
 Phoebe:Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!
 Phoebe:Shhh! I’m talking.
 Phoebe:Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
 Phoebe:No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.
 Phoebe:Not great but we can work on it at lunch. Okay I can be at your apartment in two hours.
 Phoebe:I’ve got friends too. Okay bye.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross I can’t make lunch. (Exits.)
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Yeah me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.
 Phoebe:Maybe this is too weird.
 Phoebe:No don’t tear out your eyes!!
 Phoebe:Oh yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So is that better?
 Phoebe:Look Eric turn around. (He does so.) Look I like you but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh he just touched my hand did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(He kisses her)…second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)
 Phoebe:Ooh oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
 Phoebe:No I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.
 Phoebe:Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see. (Exits.)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:What sex?
 Phoebe:We didn’t have sex.
 Phoebe:(simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
 Phoebe:You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!
 Phoebe:You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!
 Phoebe:Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.
 Phoebe:So I guess this is it.
 Phoebe:Yeah so do you.
 Phoebe:Huh?
 Phoebe:Sure. Yeah he’s kinda sexy.
 Phoebe:Okay so we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.
 Phoebe:Oh. Why not?
 Phoebe:Oh Rachel this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’
 Phoebe:Wow! Oh well I will be there!
 Phoebe:Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both sit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
 Phoebe:Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
 Phoebe:Your secret bachelorette party…
 Phoebe:She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!
 Phoebe:Oh I-I don’t eat meat.
 Phoebe:Yeah I don’t eat that either.
 Phoebe:He’s right though the ’74 is absolute piss.
 Phoebe:Rachel!
 Phoebe:Why so he can get mad at the baby?
 Phoebe:It’s slang for pregnant.
 Phoebe:I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding but I’m really busy that day. Yeah I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
 Phoebe:It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
 Phoebe:I’d better go. (She goes and sits down in the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000 the chair that Sit magazine called chair of the year and they both look at her.) Just over here I don’t want to miss the fight.
 Phoebe:That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! We were on a break! No we weren’t! What happened to you two?!
 Phoebe:(entering quietly) Wow you told your dad the truth.
 Phoebe:Wanna go see a movie?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)
 Phoebe:Yeah! And look (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (There’s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby’s born they’re great for shoplifting melons.
 Phoebe:Turkey’s are beautiful intelligent animals!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Happy Thanksgiving!
 Phoebe:Anything I can do to help?
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)
 Phoebe:Yeah it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So how’s the game?
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
 Phoebe:Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all I didn’t realize this game was on.
 Phoebe:Well normally I don’t but y’know…(looks at the TV)…Green Bay is playing.
 Phoebe:Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
 Phoebe:(nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well done.
 Phoebe:Oh okay.
 Phoebe:Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:(simultaneously) Green Bay.
 Phoebe:Well the Lions technically won but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.
 Phoebe:I think you do.
 Phoebe:What?! What else did you do?
 Phoebe:Oh come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
 Phoebe:Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
 Phoebe:So how did this happen? Did she did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
 Phoebe:I wanna join!
 Phoebe:I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn’t go to high school but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imagined it would be.
 Phoebe:Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
 Phoebe:Is there anything we can do for you?
 Phoebe:How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
 Phoebe:Ohh! Okay! Okay cause when-when he said I can’t wait to hear your first words I thought There’s a trick.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
 Phoebe:Sting has a son that goes there too!
 Phoebe:You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
 Phoebe:Sting’s son seven years old and there’s a picture.
 Phoebe:No it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.
 Phoebe:There you go! Oh you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!
 Phoebe:Wow! They’re beautiful!
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Well then get your money back and return them!
 Phoebe:Oh no! Why not?
 Phoebe:How come?!
 Phoebe:Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
 Phoebe:Sure you can! Give them some blocks put them in a playpen!
 Phoebe:Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods Yes.) (To the rest) He’s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!
 Phoebe:Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
 Phoebe:(singing) Rosssss can!
 Phoebe:(singing) Rossss can!
 Phoebe:(singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
 Phoebe:Oh there you are Ben!
 Phoebe:Well I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm the boy’s name is Sting’s son.
 Phoebe:Now Ben sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside but they have famous fathers.
 Phoebe:Him you’re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to find Jack and a teacher notices her.)
 Phoebe:Yes! Yes you can I’m looking for Jack’s parents.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh I’m with Ben.
 Phoebe:I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was it was difficult coming out to my parents.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
 Phoebe:Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk just me my lover Carol and the Stings. Umm how-how will I get in touch with them?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain but man what a hot piece of ass.
 Phoebe:Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting’s pen…that he gave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase) Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Why else would I be here?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Umm I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then could we reschedule? For say Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?
 Phoebe:Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert and he’s obviously busy during.
 Phoebe:Unless! Unless umm okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert umm all the while thinking about the children of course.
 Phoebe:Oh thank you. Four would be great.
 Phoebe:Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!
 Phoebe:The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)
 Phoebe:Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
 Phoebe:Oo where are the seats?
 Phoebe:Okay now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting his wife or a member of his family?
 Phoebe:Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest he’s not that good in bed.
 Phoebe:Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy right?
 Phoebe:This is completely normal around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
 Phoebe:Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind now I was carrying triplets so in y’know medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Yeah I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Yeah. Yeah that’s what you need a good…pill.
 Phoebe:(sitting down next to Ross) Y’know she has a face Ross!
 Phoebe:Bye.
 Phoebe:Wait I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?
 Phoebe:Oh hey! So how did your doctor’s appointment go?
 Phoebe:Oh my God.
 Phoebe:Okay remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
 Phoebe:You wish.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah? Come and get it.
 Phoebe:Ugh! Women!
 Phoebe:Give her a key to your apartment.
 Phoebe:No we hate that.

 Phoebe:Where?! (Ross exits.)
 Phoebe:Hi! Okay Monica Rachel this is my friend Roger.
 Phoebe:So umm I’m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me out?
 Phoebe:Umm he’s here to have sex with you.
 Phoebe:You’re welcome.
 Phoebe:It’s okay he’s a virgin.
 Phoebe:Yeah okay let’s leave these two alone.
 Phoebe:Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! (Phoebe exits.)
 Phoebe:Hi. Listen I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn’t right and I and I want to make it up to you so umm I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna I’m gonna want him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause) (Entering) I’m sorry I thought I could do it and I can’t! (She grabs the cutout and exits for good.)
 Phoebe:Hey! I got you a present!!
 Phoebe:I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago and it finally got here!
 Phoebe:It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
 Phoebe:I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
 Phoebe:Do you really like it?
 Phoebe:Oh really? What was your first?
 Phoebe:No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores how sad.
 Phoebe:Oh I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.
 Phoebe:Wait okay if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you then maybe I should just keep it.
 Phoebe:Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey you guys. Listen I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before—(Sees the top ten list)—Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
 Phoebe:Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!
 Phoebe:I know!
 Phoebe:Don’t touch me!!
 Phoebe:I can’t!! I can’t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
 Phoebe:Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)

 Phoebe:Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
 Phoebe:Me too!
 Phoebe:Uh huh! If it’s a girl Phoebe and if it’s a boy Phoebo!
 Phoebe:Yeah by Sandrine.
 Phoebe:How-how about you each get five vetoes?
 Phoebe:I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
 Phoebe:Is it me or is veto starting to sound really good?
 Phoebe:(from outside the bathroom) You guys?
 Phoebe:Oh hey Monica I brought back your iron.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh.
 Phoebe:Oh just as well I broke this one.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Fine.
 Phoebe:Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.

 Phoebe:Well then tell him to stop staring!
 Phoebe:Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.
 Phoebe:I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know. You know I mean on the one hand Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No I can’t. We’re friends. No oh no. I don’t want to risk what we have.

 Phoebe:Sure.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:Umm Joey I know.
 Phoebe:I knooow.
 Phoebe:I know about your feelings.
 Phoebe:Yes and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica but that’s very rare.
 Phoebe:For God sakes it’s Rachel!
 Phoebe:Yeah that’s Rachel. (To herself) Beat me over the head with it.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Joey I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
 Phoebe:Absolutely! Y’know you get this rush of feelings but then it goes away.
 Phoebe:That’s right there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.
 Phoebe:Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.
 Phoebe:Hi Bubbles. Manly. Well I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
 Phoebe:Well you were wrong he doesn’t like me!
 Phoebe:Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?
 Phoebe:Really? Lee Majors is hot!
 Phoebe:We’re in the bathroom!
 Phoebe:(checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.

 Phoebe:So do you want to hang out or something?
 Phoebe:Oh are you and Chandler…
 Phoebe:Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
 Phoebe:You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
 Phoebe:Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
 Phoebe:You told me you hate massages!
 Phoebe:I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?
 Phoebe:Oh it has a name?
 Phoebe:Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s go! (She storms out.)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hello Chandler lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!
 Phoebe:Why won’t you let me massage you?
 Phoebe:Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!
 Phoebe:I’m curious about the human body.
 Phoebe:But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance okay. Please?
 Phoebe:It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.
 Phoebe:Potato potaato.
 Phoebe:(calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?
 Phoebe:(in a soothing voice) Great let’s begin. (She starts the massage.) How’s the pressure?
 Phoebe:Stating the obvious but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.
 Phoebe:That’s right you just enjoy.
 Phoebe:(getting uncomfortable) Okay.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:No-no I got that.
 Phoebe:Okay. Okay but you should know though I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.
 Phoebe:I mean $500.
 Phoebe:600.
 Phoebe:Oh you make sex noises when you get massaged!
 Phoebe:Yeah and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
 Phoebe:Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?! (Pause) I mean hi.
 Phoebe:No you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look I have I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
 Phoebe:Well not clients lovers. But let’s just y’know try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.
 Phoebe:Yes.
 Phoebe:Great! Okay if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So did you hear something you liked?
 Phoebe:That’s it. Just relax.
 Phoebe:Come on more!
 Phoebe:Yeah you like that don’t you?
 Phoebe:You want it there? You take it there baby!
 Phoebe:Yeah say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what she’s doing.) And now I’m going to cover you back up and umm we’re never doing this again.
 Phoebe:Oh! Hey Rach!
 Phoebe:Oh you too.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:(sighs) Honey I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
 Phoebe:Oh Gunther can I get a scone?
 Phoebe:So how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
 Phoebe:Ugh. Come on Mona don’t kiss ass.
 Phoebe:All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh Rachel wanted to see this tape!
 Phoebe:It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
 Phoebe:Yeah. Candy’s the mother Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
 Phoebe:Oh Monica grow up!
 Phoebe:(knocking and entering) Hey. Look I know you’ve been really depressed lately so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real live furry playmate.
 Phoebe:He-hee!
 Phoebe:This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
 Phoebe:How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
 Phoebe:Taffy really? I’ve never had any.
 Phoebe:Well I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what you’re just never going to tell her?
 Phoebe:If I haven’t said it before she’s a lucky lucky lady! So where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the taffy which she’s been chewing this whole time.) Oh God. Is it gum is it food? What’s the deal? (she swallows it finally) Oh it’s nice! May I try a pink one?
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey buddy. How’s my favorite dog huh? How’s my favorite dog? (the dog doesn’t move) You’re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?
 Phoebe:Will you excuse us we need to talk for a moment.
 Phoebe:He’s miserable! What happened to him?
 Phoebe:What stuff?
 Phoebe:Oh…Joey you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world and he spends half a day with you and look at him!
 Phoebe:Okay I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.
 Phoebe:(entering) Oh hey you guys!
 Phoebe:Hey listen let me ask you do you believe in soul mates?
 Phoebe:Uh-huh (To Chandler) and you?
 Phoebe:Okay good.
 Phoebe:Well last night I met Monica’s.
 Phoebe:Yeah I had a date with this guy and I swear to God he is her other half.
 Phoebe:Well he’s tall.
 Phoebe:He has brown hair.
 Phoebe:He works with food!
 Phoebe:Obviously and he’s British.
 Phoebe:Yeah? And he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
 Phoebe:Oh I’m so sorry. Um and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again I’ll find out more.
 Phoebe:Well he may not be my soul mate but a girl’s gotta eat.
 Phoebe:Oh! Hi!
 Phoebe:Umm Chandler Monica this is Don.
 Phoebe:(mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
 Phoebe:(cough talks) Soul mate.
 Phoebe:Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…
 Phoebe:They’re just talking and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Don’t worry we’ll find you someone else.
 Phoebe:I’m so sorry.
 Phoebe:I don’t know they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.
 Phoebe:Okay so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know and-and y’know one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
 Phoebe:Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh I see a ladder. (Checks the book) Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
 Phoebe:Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm who’s next?
 Phoebe:Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm oh! Okay I see a circle.
 Phoebe:Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!
 Phoebe:Umm… Wow all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)
 Phoebe:(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. (He gets up to leave and smiles at Phoebe.)
 Phoebe:Oh hello.
 Phoebe:Oh Jim Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
 Phoebe:Well maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and the exchange information.)
 Phoebe:Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.
 Phoebe:Oh witty banter. Well done.
 Phoebe:Oh okay well I’m a masseuse and I used to work at this place…
 Phoebe:I-I-I like I like parties.
 Phoebe:Yeah I guess a little.
 Phoebe:(a little freaked out) So! Umm anyway I-I lived in New York someone wildly I guess for umm—Well since I was fourteen.
 Phoebe:Oh stop it.
 Phoebe:Okay. Umm look you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wow! You do?
 Phoebe:All right. (Gets up and walks out.)
 Phoebe:Oh there it is.
 Phoebe:I know but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store a new bank a new adult bookstore a new grocery store…
 Phoebe:A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.
 Phoebe:Yeah we both can. And we both will.
 Phoebe:Oh you didn’t have to come in with me.
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh yeah well I’m sorry about that too but what are you going to do?
 Phoebe:A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now you’re talking.
 Phoebe:I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.
 Phoebe:(looking around) She must’ve left.
 Phoebe:Oh Ross Mon is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?
 Phoebe:Well his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
 Phoebe:Yeah he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life and he treats me like a queen except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Everybody this is Parker Parker this is…
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:I’ll go with you
 Phoebe:Were you guys making fun of Parker?
 Phoebe:So he a little enthusiastic what’s wrong with that?
 Phoebe:Well so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag Janice Mona? No because friends don’t do that. But do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap. (Walks off)
 Phoebe:No I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.
 Phoebe:Hm huh yeah.
 Phoebe:No that’s not necessary.
 Phoebe:No actually I don’t eat…
 Phoebe:Okay fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor) Mmm…hmmmmm….
 Phoebe:Why don’t you just try one?
 Phoebe:Then you better do it now.
 Phoebe:Because I’m going to kill him
 Phoebe:You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.
 Phoebe:Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?
 Phoebe:He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.
 Phoebe:You think?
 Phoebe:You’re right. You’re right he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny positive person.
 Phoebe:What’s that now?
 Phoebe:Oh look it’s Parker!
 Phoebe:Oooh I love it!
 Phoebe:Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
 Phoebe:Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
 Phoebe:Oh thank God.
 Phoebe:Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
 Phoebe:Let’s try something else let’s play a game.
 Phoebe:Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (Giggles)
 Phoebe:But let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Oh my God!
 Phoebe:Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights Parker!
 Phoebe:You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.
 Phoebe:No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac at Disneyland getting laid!
 Phoebe:Much less happy!
 Phoebe:So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)
 Phoebe:Uh huh. (Closes door)
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)
 Phoebe:I’m gonna get some coffee anyone want anything?
 Phoebe:(interrupting him) I was just being polite!
 Phoebe:Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
 Phoebe:Umm I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
 Phoebe:Umm Phoebe Buffay.
 Phoebe:Oh okay it’s P as in Phoebe H as in hoebe O as in oebe E as in ebe B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) ‘Ello there mate!
 Phoebe:Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
 Phoebe:Ohhh.
 Phoebe:(turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey thats not a Nutter-Butter thats just an old Wonton!
 Phoebe:Ohh tough call.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
 Phoebe:Oh please!
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:About twenty a couple people from work who had something else to do.
 Phoebe:Well I don’t I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…
 Phoebe:No. (Pause) Neither is mine.
 Phoebe:I know. I know what’s her number?
 Phoebe:Isn’t it at three?
 Phoebe:Oh I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?
 Phoebe:What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi Mrs. Green!
 Phoebe:I’m so glad you could make it.
 Phoebe:Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
 Phoebe:No look we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
 Phoebe:For how long?
 Phoebe:She can’t hear you.
 Phoebe:Well if you don’t want your mother to move in with you just tell her.
 Phoebe:I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!
 Phoebe:How about you less important people let’s open your presents!
 Phoebe:Okay come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.
 Phoebe:Okay this is from your friend at work.
 Phoebe:Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
 Phoebe:Not if you were here.
 Phoebe:No not a thing.
 Phoebe:Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely albeit slightly boring shower and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.
 Phoebe:Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her I’d tell her off.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh!
 Phoebe:(To Monica) Wrap it up wrap it up wrap it up…
 Phoebe:You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!
 Phoebe:You should be!
 Phoebe:You got it!
 Phoebe:Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
 Phoebe:Hey! Oh how did baby shopping go?
 Phoebe:What?!
 Phoebe:Well did she know you two weren’t married?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man we-we must alert the church elders!
 Phoebe:Sounds like you’re a little jealous.
 Phoebe:Is that a real place? (Rachel’s stunned) Are they hiring?
 Phoebe:Hey Chandler why so fancy?
 Phoebe:Wait I think I know someone who does that.
 Phoebe:Yeah just don’t get your hopes up.
 Phoebe:Well the interview…
 Phoebe:Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.
 Phoebe:Oh you don’t know.
 Phoebe:Yes when I first met you you were like Blah blah blah. I was like shhh!
 Phoebe:Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes y’know you just—You come off a little needy.
 Phoebe:Oh! It’s okay you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
 Phoebe:All right don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
 Phoebe:I can’t help you.
 Phoebe:All right all right we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. Hi! Come on in I’m uh Regina Philange.
 Phoebe:Bing what an unusual name.
 Phoebe:Um-hmm that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do and start focusing on what you do do.
 Phoebe:I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
 Phoebe:You gotta go!
 Phoebe:Okay don’t worry. You’re ready.
 Phoebe:Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.
 Phoebe:I started that!
 Phoebe:Oh I know I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…
 Phoebe:Or you can do volunteer work.
 Phoebe:Joey you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe Phoebe.
 Phoebe:(still mimicking a heartbeat only faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)
 Phoebe:Mon maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
 Phoebe:When she comes out you hold her nose I’ll blow in her mouth and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
 Phoebe:I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.
 Phoebe:You’re on!
 Phoebe:One hundred thousand dollars!
 Phoebe:Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.
 Phoebe:No one’s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!
 Phoebe:Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh you’re still pregnant. Oh I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah like fifty bucks.
 Phoebe:It’s interesting that you lost. Now I forget do you like to lose?
 Phoebe:Fine! You’re on!
 Phoebe:Until then General Grant why don’t you set up camp (She puts the bill in her bra) right there.
 Phoebe:Good God man don’t anger it.
 Phoebe:Oh I-I don’t know about that. No I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
 Phoebe:Thank you!
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:Is Rachel having the baby?
 Phoebe:They’re at the coffeehouse.
 Phoebe:We know it’s a girl! (Exits.)
 Phoebe:Oh you made it!
 Phoebe:(looking at the clock) Oh wow three hours and still no baby. Ugh the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
 Phoebe:Sure! What?
 Phoebe:Oh this is fun.
 Phoebe:Yeah. (Pause) Why aren’t you with Rachel?
 Phoebe:But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
 Phoebe:Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)
 Phoebe:I know!
 Phoebe:Oh it ate your money?
 Phoebe:All right I’ll see you downstairs then.
 Phoebe:All right.
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button but can’t.) I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)
 Phoebe:Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
 Phoebe:Well it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about you?
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Uh-huh yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
 Phoebe:Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
 Phoebe:(to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm he’s like early to mid-thirties very attractive.
 Phoebe:Oh yay! Great! Okay what room number is he in?
 Phoebe:Hands.
 Phoebe:Thank you. (Starts to exit.)
 Phoebe:(coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)
 Phoebe:Ooh this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh that’s him! That’s him!
 Phoebe:Wait a second or maybe you can go in first.
 Phoebe:No not you Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.
 Phoebe:But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
 Phoebe:What else? What else?
 Phoebe:Oh. Ah-uh.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Enter Pheebs.
 Phoebe:Okay I’ve got one for you if you had too which one would you rather eat a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
 Phoebe:Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it? I’m sorry. (She moves her arm which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)
 Phoebe:Oh I’ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)
 Phoebe:Relax it’s not like we’re forking.
 Phoebe:Y’know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as Cliff sees something on TV.)
 Phoebe:Huh. Okay Mr. Perkazet.
 Phoebe:Cliff do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
 Phoebe:Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.
 Phoebe:You’re right that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just can we just start over?
 Phoebe:Uh Joey we’re trying to dial down the crazy.
 Phoebe:Umm look we don’t we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.
 Phoebe:Can we come in?
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Oh she’s so beautiful.
 Phoebe:Okay my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You’re so cute! Oh I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won’t.
 Phoebe:Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)
 Phoebe:Oh wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
 Phoebe:Yay!
 Phoebe:Is she in there?
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:I just can’t decide who she looks more alike you or Rachel?
 Phoebe:I’m sorry for the last time why aren’t you two together again? (Silence from Ross.) No I know. I know because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine except you totally are.
 Phoebe:Yeah that’s true. Yeah you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
 Phoebe:I know. I know. I know. I know and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
 Phoebe:Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.
 Phoebe:(To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
 Phoebe:To see if know what these guys are talking about.
 Phoebe:(taking Ross aside) Have umm have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
 Phoebe:Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow you could’ve done that with us there.
 Phoebe:Oh sure okay you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.
 Phoebe:Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Are you all right?
 Phoebe:Oh my God! He did it?
 Phoebe:Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
 Phoebe:I just talked him into it don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
 Phoebe:Why?! You two are so meant to be together everybody thinks so.
 Phoebe:Especially Ross!
 Phoebe:There he goes your fianc�e.
 Phoebe:Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
 Phoebe:Oh hey! Wait up!
 Phoebe:Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.
 Phoebe:No! No that you and Rachel are engaged!
 Phoebe:Oh it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.
 Phoebe:Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
 Phoebe:All right me too. (They go into her room and see that she’s sleeping.) Should we wake her up?
 Phoebe:And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
 Phoebe:Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
 Phoebe:Really?
 Phoebe:So whose ring is it?
 Phoebe:Is it an engagement ring?
 Phoebe:But you didn’t give it to her?
 Phoebe:But you were going to propose?
 Phoebe:Huh I might be losing interest in this.
 Phoebe:Oh what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
 Phoebe:No! No she said you actually proposed to her.
 Phoebe:No they ran out of It’s a girl but I can fix this one (She writes not in between it’s and a) See?
 Phoebe:Look at all the stuff people sent!
 Phoebe:She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
 Phoebe:Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!
 Phoebe:I dunno well he got over the We were on a break thing really quickly.
 Phoebe:You know that’s… that’s her.
 Phoebe:Oh no Rach no no you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
 Phoebe:I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.
 Phoebe:It really does… how long do you think we have to stay?
 Phoebe:Well alright we already tried feeding her changing her burping her oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
 Phoebe:Yeah no kidding this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
 Phoebe:Alright you guys we can’t turn on each other Okay?  That’s just what she wants.
 Phoebe:Oh I’m kinda part of this.
 Phoebe:I knew I should have married Chandler.
 Phoebe:Well alright looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her upset and Monica just stares.) No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)
 Phoebe:Alright I’ll try fine! Yes Okay!
 Phoebe:Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
 Phoebe:I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
 Phoebe:(entering) Have I gone deaf?
 Phoebe:You must be a fireball in bed.
 Phoebe:I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I’m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
 Phoebe:Thankfully you don’t need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let’s give it six to eight months (she leaves).

 Phoebe:(Walks towards Ross) If you hadnt just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
 Phoebe:Im not going along with some lie you made Ross No Im just gonna be honest with him.
 Phoebe:yeah Ive nothing to be ashamed of ok so I havent been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I havent had a real boyfriend you know if he cant handle that he can leave. which he will and thats ok. so Ill just be alone forever you know alright Ill be. itll be fine. itll be fine. Ill go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh (takes a deep breath and sits down knock on the door)
 Phoebe:ok
 Phoebe:Uh huh yeah (stands up) theres just something umm theres something you should know (Pause) Vicrum just called.
 Phoebe:.and I said Vicrum you cant just call every time you get lonely you know you you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
 Phoebe:yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emmas birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
 Phoebe:I know but he calls and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:ok I cant do this.
 Phoebe:well there is no Vicrum Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship Ive never lived with a guy and Ive never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if thats too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact Ill close my eyes make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses her Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me.
 Phoebe:so you dont think Im a total freak
 Phoebe:I guess so can I. can I think its cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls back) and umm be a little concerned about the magic markers.
 Phoebe:you know maybe this is a wake up call about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirtys and youve never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship here you go from woman to woman meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesnt tern into anything serious.
 Phoebe:Oh hey you guys I couldn�t get a reservation for the night of my birthday so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
 Phoebe:So?
 Phoebe:No! It�s my first birthday with a boyfriend and he has to work. Uch I get mad at him but I think it�s a little to soon to show my true colors.
 Phoebe:Oh Rachel!
 Phoebe:Oh yay!
 Phoebe:Alright okay so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey you know what? We all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.

 Phoebe:Where is everyone? They�re forty minutes late.
 Phoebe:I�m starving. I know we were coming here tonight I ate nothing all day.
 Phoebe:Yes they are expected presently. Yeah yeah um their arrival is in the offing.
 Phoebe:Joseph! (to waiter) Thou needn�t worry they shan�t be long.
 Phoebe:One really does have a stick up one�s ass. Doesn�t one?
 Phoebe:No you can�t go. No-no-no I can�t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move I cave.
 Phoebe:Okay fine I�ll move. Alright you don�t have to manhandle me. (gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you. Wach.
 Phoebe:Well I guess they�re not coming. You wanna just order?
 Phoebe:Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
 Phoebe:Both it is thank you.
 Phoebe:You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
 Phoebe:And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
 Phoebe:Wher-where have you been?
 Phoebe:You guys we�ve been waiting for you for a long time maybe you should order.
 Phoebe:Aw � what?
 Phoebe:�s a good toast.
 Phoebe:(getting up) Oh for god�s sake Judy pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) I�m sorry was that rude? Di-did my my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look I know you all have a lot going on but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn�t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well it�s too late now.
 Phoebe:well this is this is this is not over! (on phone) Hello?
 Phoebe:(returns) Okay that was Mike.
 Phoebe:Mhuh guys that means the world to me. Huh nkay I�m gonna take off.
 Phoebe:Oh I love you guys too but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.
 Phoebe:I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar shakes it and then realises she cant open it with one hand but doesnt want to let go of Mikes hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
 Phoebe:Yeah I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well hows this? (she takes Mikes hand and puts it on her breast she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that they hold hands again. Joey now enters and sees the two sitting on the couch holding hands.)
 Phoebe:Im sorry... Im sorry. Its obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
 Phoebe:(in a flash she answers) Maybe not is it?
 Phoebe:(impatient) I know Mike why dont you keep digging?
 Phoebe:Oh its a key. To be honest I think Id prefer the five dollars.
 Phoebe:(really surprised) Oh wow ooh! Ooh big step for Phoebe and Mike.
 Phoebe:Oh no I want to.
 Phoebe:Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think Id never meet someone that you know I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)
 Phoebe:It really is.
 Phoebe:(gasps) Oh my God! David!
 Phoebe:(excited) No! Its a great time come in...! WOW hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
 Phoebe:Who cares it got you here.
 Phoebe:Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)
 Phoebe:A-Allright well... Ill call the cab company.
 Phoebe:Thank you! God no! You should see me when... Oh actually no I look pretty good.
 Phoebe:No...
 Phoebe:Im... Im just... Im the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that Im seeing Mike?
 Phoebe:He said Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
 Phoebe:Yeah! I mean I dont know. I was just  I was looking I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking Oh my God! Its David. Davids here. Hes just hes so irresistible.
 Phoebe:Really? Chandler?
 Phoebe:Oh.Okay then it gets worse cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
 Phoebe:I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much you know. Its just going really well. Oh my God!
 Phoebe:(sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...! you know. And given my life long search for irony you can imagine how happy I am.
 Phoebe:I mean I guess I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I dont... You know complicated moral situation no right no wrong...
 Phoebe:Okay I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Okay. (and she walks away)
 Phoebe:No but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
 Phoebe:Oof...
 Phoebe:Oh wait wait!
 Phoebe:No no its not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
 Phoebe:Yeah I should have told you.
 Phoebe:Im sorry Im sorry.
 Phoebe:I am happy.
 Phoebe:Well... but David just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things Ive ever had to do.
 Phoebe:Of course yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know a kiss on the cheek wouldnt be totally inappropriate...
 Phoebe:I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek makes his way to the door and turns around again)
 Phoebe:Yeah?
 Phoebe:Well if thats what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... its... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
 Phoebe:Hmmm... No no... No I cant do this. Its bad.
 Phoebe:No no. No.
 Phoebe:Look David if... if you had never left then... yeah wed probably still be together right now but... you did leave and I-Im with Mike and I really care about him...
 Phoebe:(points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
 Phoebe:No no no no no... Its not... its not... its not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
 Phoebe:No uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago and he lives in Minsk. Hes only... hes only in town for a couple of days.
 Phoebe:No no...
 Phoebe:Oh well yeah...
 Phoebe:Stop it! Stop it before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets Davids jacket and gives it to him) Here David you should just go.
 Phoebe:Okay well... guys?
 Phoebe:Im sorry Im so sorry. If you... If you want your key back I totally understand.
 Phoebe:Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.)
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Listen! You have to help me pick a dress cause Im meeting Mikes parents tonight! (Rachel gasps)
 Phoebe:(sarcastically) Really? That hadnt occurred to me.
 Phoebe:They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
 Phoebe:Okay so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up two Phoebe dresses Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time dont wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say neither.
 Phoebe:So... now... What about with Mikes mom?
 Phoebe:(speaking louder and articulating) Thats shes like the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks at Phoebe in a duh! way)
 Phoebe:Im wearing pantyhose!
 Phoebe:Oh thank you! Oh... Oh my God youre RICH!
 Phoebe:Yeah so... They gotta die someday. (Mikes parents walk in) HELLO!
 Phoebe:(in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
 Phoebe:And you... Your home is lovely.
 Phoebe:Holy crap!
 Phoebe:Oh try and stop me!
 Phoebe:(no accent) Im trying to get your parents to like me.
 Phoebe:(accent) Got it! It... Its hard to stop...
 Phoebe:(no accent) Uhm... Okay well allright uhm... Originally Im from upstate but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay that was okay until uhm... I got hepatitis you know cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway now Im uhm... a freelance massage therapist uhm... which you know isnt always steady money but at least I dont pay taxes huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit surreal which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) So... where does everyone summer?
 Phoebe:God! God! This is not going well.
 Phoebe:Okay okay okay okay... Still sure about me being myself?
 Phoebe:So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
 Phoebe:Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
 Phoebe:Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right in the stomach)
 Phoebe:Oh my God are you okay?
 Phoebe:Im so sorry!
 Phoebe:I really really am sorry.
 Phoebe:Yes... Im sorry Ive never met a boyfriends parents before...
 Phoebe:Yeah okay... yeah your mom... okay... She looks nice I can talk to her.
 Phoebe:Yeah... Oh Bitsy hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
 Phoebe:Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
 Phoebe:Well and you know it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because hes very respectful of women.
 Phoebe:Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... youd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
 Phoebe:(Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no no no no no no. Dont get me wrong. No hes not in like a sissy way. No no no... when he gets going he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
 Phoebe:...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat Sme-lly ca-t / I-ts not your fau-lt. And thats the end of the song... I realise that you didnt ask to hear it but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
 Phoebe:Oh Pervert Parade?
 Phoebe:Oh Ode To A Pubic Hair?
 Phoebe:Oh God! Is that veal?
 Phoebe:Oh no no no no... Thats okay thats okay... I mean Im... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no veal I love...
 Phoebe:No no no I actually its any baby animals kittens fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this this nice vein of fat running through it... (she cuts the meat picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth which she keeps closed trying to overcome her vegetarian thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... Clearly not enjoying the meat...) Hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it except Mike. Hes making a hmmmm.... face... Then Phoebe swallows it) Hmmm... (at first she likes it but then in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. You hear a door slamming.)
 Phoebe:Yeah... The woman you what?
 Phoebe:I love you too...
 Phoebe:YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss)
 Phoebe:Okay.
 Phoebe:I had a great time. (accent) It was really top drawer. And heres something rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
 Phoebe:Hey everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
 Phoebe:Hey whats going on Joe?
 Phoebe:Oh okay. How about the whole man walking on the moon thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
 Phoebe:Ooh honey. You stink at lying.
 Phoebe:Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house I went to the bathroom and when I came back my muffin was gone-who took it?
 Phoebe:Dont worry dont worry. Well come up with a good lie. Ill help you practice it.
 Phoebe:Sure what.. what was the work thing?
 Phoebe:Pick up grandma at the airport?
 Phoebe:Oh right ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when youre talking people know youre lying.
 Phoebe:Thats a great movie. <she claps>
 Phoebe:PHOE-BE.
 Phoebe:Theres your movie! <claps>
 Phoebe:Its ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. Its easy to remember and doesnt invite a lot of questions. You werent at the parade because you had a family emergency.
 Phoebe:Ooh what happened?
 Phoebe:No! Nothing with a raccoon.
 Phoebe:Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
 Phoebe:Oh my god! Shouldnt we stop this?
 Phoebe:Its all right. You can mourn.
 Phoebe:Hey does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
 Phoebe:Broke them all huh?

 Phoebe:Joey can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
 Phoebe:Im sorry its just Im a little short on cash. 
 Phoebe:Oh no no no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No thats why Richard Dreyfuss and I dont speak anymore.

 Phoebe:Okay from the top people!
 Phoebe:Joey listen. I cant do this it doesnt make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse and today Im a waitress at a cafe?
 Phoebe:Well its not okay because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly Im the waitress? Thats gonna confuse my fans. 
 Phoebe:Uhuh. Because Im a single mother supporting my two children.
 Phoebe:Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldnt I come over to say hi to him?
 Phoebe:About what?
 Phoebe:And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
 Phoebe:Yeah well Im very angry at him because he slept with me and never called me back.
 Phoebe:I cant do that. Im an actor. I have a process.
 Phoebe:Wait a minute I see whats happening here. Youre threatened. 
 Phoebe:Yeah Im so good in this scene that Im stealing focus from you. Well rise to the challenge Tribianni cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
 Phoebe:Hey Mike whats the capital of Peru?
 Phoebe:No. It starts with a v and ends with an x. Helpfully with a to in the middle.
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:(relived) Oh whew no thats Bob.
 Phoebe:Well not so much a pet as you know an occasional visitor who I put food out for you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesnt poop on the plate of cookies.
 Phoebe:What are those?
 Phoebe:OK fine if it means that much to you Ill get rid of Bob.
 Phoebe:So weird you think hes so gross and youre willing to eat his crackers. (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)
 Phoebe:Hey Mikey
 Phoebe:What are you doing?
 Phoebe:To kill Bob??
 Phoebe:No Mike I dont want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and and you know set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
 Phoebe:Ill find Bob Ill get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at cabinet under sink) Oh wait I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bobs a mom!
 Phoebe:I dont know I kinda like Bob for a girl.
 Phoebe:Oh my god we killed Bob!
 Phoebe:Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
 Phoebe:Be careful be careful! These are my rat babies!
 Phoebe:I had to bring them! We killed their mother theyre our responsibility now. You know they require constant care. You should know that Rachel youre a mother.
 Phoebe:No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home we need feed them.
 Phoebe:Well Im sorry Rachel but Im not like you ok? Not everyone can afford help. (she and Mike leave)
 Phoebe:Ok ok you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
 Phoebe:Well you know what theyre our responsibility now.
 Phoebe:Mate? Theyre all brothers and sisters.
 Phoebe:No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? Thats like ... (starts counting with her fingers) Thats math I cant even do! What are we gonna do?
 Phoebe:Yeah ok. I guess youre right. Allright so we should just give them away. But to nice families with children and reduced fat wheat thins. Theyre Bobs favorites.
 Phoebe:You must think Im crazy.
 Phoebe:Good. Its just so hard its hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories you know from ... when I gave birth to my brothers triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I havent told you about that yet have I?
 Phoebe:(walks in) Hey
 Phoebe:Listen I think Ive left something here.
 Phoebe:(likes the jacket) No but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
 Phoebe:(realizes) Ooh maybe thats him!
 Phoebe:Well it depends.
 Phoebe:On how far along hes in the sex change process!
 Phoebe:Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
 Phoebe:Wow! Talking about high maintenance
 Phoebe:Im a woman!

 Phoebe:But everybody sings. Its so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there forgot all of the words flipped out
 Phoebe:Oh! Whats the matter? Are you scared? Youre afraid Im a better singer? Youre afraid Im gonna beat you at singing?

 Phoebe:Mon not that you didn�t sound good but...
 Phoebe:Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
 Phoebe:Yes she gives the people what they want.
 Phoebe:Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didnt see that before I wouldnt have let her go up again.
 Phoebe:Hey.
 Phoebe:What you got?
 Phoebe:Goodie! Thanks. So how is it living with Rachel again? I mean apart from the great food.
 Phoebe:Oh my god Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
 Phoebe:I dont know. Theyre so perfect for each other; its crazy.
 Phoebe:I just wish theyd realise they should be together.
 Phoebe:I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
 Phoebe:You know what? Maybe once they start dating and they see whats out there theyll realise how good they are for each other.
 Phoebe:So what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
 Phoebe:Yeah. (BEAT) Oh I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates so that theyll realise how good they are together.
 Phoebe:Yeah you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my plan-laugh. (A maniacal laugh follows.)
 Phoebe:Ooh Joey.
 Phoebe:Hey. Im so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
 Phoebe:Well its this guy I used to massage. And by massage I mean hold down so he wouldnt turn over and flash me.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah.
 Phoebe:A teacher?
 Phoebe:Well Ross does. What... Youre - youre ruining the plan! Joey youve - youve fixed him up with his perfect woman!
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:How do you even know a woman like that?
 Phoebe:Joey.
 Phoebe:So now what do we do?
 Phoebe:What if we dont find him somebody else? Well just tell her the dates off but we dont tell Ross and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
 Phoebe:Ooh so this is great! Rachels gonna have a terrible date Ross gets stood up and then theyll realise how good they have it together.
 Phoebe:Its not Santas plan. No its... (Laughs the real plan-laugh.)
 Phoebe:No I think we killed it.
 Phoebe:Hello?
 Phoebe:Hey Rach!
 Phoebe:You know you are talking about one of my dear dear friends.
 Phoebe:Oh right so he gets a little crazy when hes stoned.
 Phoebe:Did he go out for a cigarette?
 Phoebe:My dear sweet Rach.
 Phoebe:By the time anyones figured out what weve done well be in sunny Mexico. (BEAT) Oh wait thats the end of a different plan.
 Phoebe:Now wait a minute. So theyre gonna name their first child Joey?
 Phoebe:How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
 Phoebe:Oh so they owe me like three Phoebes.
 Phoebe:Oh my god! Look its Ross and Rachel. Oh the plan is working.

 Phoebe:Oh yeah theyre falling in love all over again.
 Phoebe:Oh they see us! Oh they they look mad. Oh they figured it out. Theyre coming this way. Run!

 Phoebe:(shocked) Oh my god…
 Phoebe:No… actually you might wanna stay away from Jane street… thats where stabby Joe works. 
 Phoebe:Okay I think we have a problem here. 
 Phoebe:Well uhm back in my mugging days you know I uhm I worked St. Marcs Comics. 
 Phoebe:Well a pipe was my weapon of choice and uhm pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. 
 Phoebe:Well there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
 Phoebe:I know… I mugged Ross! 
 Phoebe:(spotting Ross) Hey you!
 Phoebe:Hey how was class?
 Phoebe:Nothing I really wanna know.
 Phoebe:(interrupting) Alright nothing is worth this. Uhm I have a confession to make… uhm okay you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…

 Phoebe:Yes it was. 
 Phoebe:(interrupting pinching his year) Gimme your money punk!
 Phoebe:(apologetic) Yeah and Im so so sorry Ross Im sorry but you know if you think about it its kinda neat. (She smiles at him but he doesnt understand) I mean well its just that I Ive always felt kinda like an outsider you know the rest of you have these connections that go way back and you know now you and I have… have a great one! 
 Phoebe:I know Im sorry please forgive me. I dont know what to say…
 Phoebe:Really? Even more humiliating than…
 Phoebe:Hey Ross! (He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her) I know youre still mad at me but can I just talk to you for a second? 
 Phoebe:I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think youll find very exciting. 
 Phoebe:Look Ross in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke. (Ross looks at her in astonishment) Anyway I was looking through it and I found Science Boy (She holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to Ross)
 Phoebe:I cant say I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. 
 Phoebe:Yeah… but you should know I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. 
 Phoebe:Youre welcome. And thank you for Science Boy. I learned a lot from him 
 Phoebe:Why??
 Phoebe:Oh...you dont have to go I have something that will fit you.
 Phoebe:I want you to stay.
 Phoebe:Why dont you turn them inside ou...
 Phoebe:Ill miss you.
 Phoebe:Great! Ok...Ill go get the tube top.
 Phoebe:Wow Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say Hell yeah!

 Phoebe:Ive always wanted to live with a guy. Pick up your socks! Put down the toilet seat! No! Were not having sex anymore! Its gonna be fun!
 Phoebe:Hey you guys! Ok weve got great news.
 Phoebe:I know its so exciting! You know Ive never lived with a guy before.
 Phoebe:Okay well you put down the toilet seat.
 Phoebe:Uh huh...were playing you two.
 Phoebe:Monica slow down! Ok? Im just excited to be living with him. You know I mean I dont know Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Yknow..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
 Phoebe:I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
 Phoebe:Yeah! You bet roomy!
 Phoebe:Oh please these guys we havent even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)
 Phoebe:China patterns!!!!!
 Phoebe:Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase its a play on the word roomy.
 Phoebe:Oh no! No no! Not at all. Were just moving in right now. See where it goes.
 Phoebe:What do you mean?
 Phoebe:Oh. Wow.
 Phoebe:Was it really that bad?
 Phoebe:Ok well thats bad. But dont you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
 Phoebe:But its just...
 Phoebe:Oh!
 Phoebe:No! I definitely dont wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didnt want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind theres gonna be hell to pay mister!
 Phoebe:Yeah I get that.
 Phoebe:Hi
 Phoebe:Listen I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
 Phoebe:No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
 Phoebe:Mike doesnt ever wanna get married.
 Phoebe:Never.
 Phoebe:I want to but I just want you to tell me that marriage isnt really that big a deal. You know that I wont I wont be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
 Phoebe:Thats not how you really feel is it?
 Phoebe:Seriously? You divorce-o?
 Phoebe:Its ok thats how you feel.
 Phoebe:I do love Mike.
 Phoebe:Yeah I guess youre right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
 Phoebe:Its not cooler.
 Phoebe:Better.
 Phoebe:Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah no thanks you.
 Phoebe:What do you mean?
 Phoebe:They are awfully boxy...
 Phoebe:Uh huh.
 Phoebe:Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... theres no wiggle room? None at all?
 Phoebe:Right. Except that I do want to get married.
 Phoebe:Someday.
 Phoebe:I havent exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now its my turn some of the regular stuff.
 Phoebe:Because I just didnt know how much I wanted it. And I love you and I wanted to live with you.
 Phoebe:But I dont think I can! it was ok to move in when I didnt know what was gonna happen but I cant move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
 Phoebe:Are you gonna change yours?
 Phoebe:Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
 Phoebe:I dont want it to end either.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Hi.
 Phoebe:Breaking up sucks! Oh I really miss Mike!
 Phoebe:Oh God I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I cant think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica I really need your help getting through this...
 Phoebe:Well no when I get to the point where... you know... Im ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... Im gonna come to you.
 Phoebe:Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know Mike never wants to get married and I shouldnt be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon Im gonna miss him so much. Im gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
 Phoebe:(after a pause) Unless... Maybe its too crazy about this... Alright so... you know there is no future... but that doesnt mean we still cant have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
 Phoebe:That was a test and you just failed.
 Phoebe:God I wish Mike were here.
 Phoebe:I gotta call him. Just to talk to him theres no harm in that.
 Phoebe:Here.
 Phoebe:Okay (she takes a huge clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)
 Phoebe:Yes.
 Phoebe:Yes it reminds me of a simpler time.
 Phoebe:You cant have it.
 Phoebe:No (tucks it in her pants)
 Phoebe:(disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
 Phoebe:Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
 Phoebe:You know its a lot less surprising to do that after Ive buzzed you into the building.
 Phoebe:Those are my shoes.
 Phoebe:Monica I really appreciate you checking in on me but Im actually feeling a lot better. Yeah I just kinda want to be alone right now.
 Phoebe:I ordered Chinese food.
 Phoebe:What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
 Phoebe:Im sorry I broke down... I wanted to see him.
 Phoebe:There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
 Phoebe:Not if nothing happens. Why cant... why cant we just hang out as friends?
 Phoebe:Sit down.
 Phoebe:Thanks you look good too.
 Phoebe:So hows the piano playing going?
 Phoebe:Ive missed you too.
 Phoebe:I know I want that too but IS that going to make it too hard?
 Phoebe:What?
 Phoebe:Oh I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)
 Phoebe:Who is this?
 Phoebe:Hey will you get me tickets too?
 Phoebe:You dont wanna win the lottery?
 Phoebe:(excited)Hey you guys! Ok youre not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
 Phoebe:Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. Its really not fair either! You know just because we dont eat the meat doesnt mean we dont like to play with the carcasses!
 Phoebe:I hope I win!
 Phoebe:One two three!
 Phoebe:Get a room!
 Phoebe:Oooh I like that daddy (in a sexy tone)
 Phoebe:(still in sexy tone) Oooh is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
 Phoebe:Ok well are all the tickets in the bowl?
 Phoebe:Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
 Phoebe:Oh you guys! Weve got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)
 Phoebe:(she takes the bowl from Rachels hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!
 Phoebe:(keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she stops) Fine I cant take it anymore! Im putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)
 Phoebe:If we are not doing it together were not doing it at all! So say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).
 Phoebe:Dont come any closer!
 Phoebe:No whats more important your friends or money?
 Phoebe:Hey Monica what about your extra tickets?
 Phoebe:Ok good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down scaring Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God no! (pause) I think I broke your bowl.
 Phoebe:What a beautiful night to be running around the street looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
 Phoebe:So what? Monica we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win remember?
 Phoebe:As a matter of fact she said thats how I am going to die. (pause ) So excuse me for being a little skittish.
 Phoebe:Well I bet that was very hard for him to do.
 Phoebe:Guys the drawing is about to start!
 Phoebe:Im still looking through mine...
 Phoebe:You guys what was the Powerball number again?
 Phoebe:We won.
 Phoebe:We won!
 Phoebe:Dont tear it.
 Phoebe:I know that but look weve got the Powerball number weve won 3 dollars!
 Phoebe:(still very excited) I dont care Ive never won anything before I cant believe this!
 Phoebe:Its not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
 Phoebe:I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).
 Phoebe:(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the pigeon voice from before) Coo again. Dont blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me the pigeon coo! (pause) Seriously stop staring at her.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:Well I cant give you a massage because my licence has been revoked again!
 Phoebe:Well it was an accident...You know its a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
 Phoebe:Oh no!You guys arent supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
 Phoebe:Oh good!Ok good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
 Phoebe:And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
 Phoebe:(playing guitar and singing) And theres a country called Argentinaaaa its a place Ive never seeeeen. But Im told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!
 Phoebe:Well you said that you had customers lined up in the street so I am here to entertain!
 Phoebe:Yeah! It really has been great too you know some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah You suck and shut up and go home.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:But what?
 Phoebe:(pause) Ok say no more.
 Phoebe:(with a fancy dress still playing and singing) It wasnt just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasnt just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica showing her dress) Classy uh?
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Here Monica look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
 Phoebe:Right yeah ok Ill ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
 Phoebe:Oh ok. Fine Ill just Ill take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
 Phoebe:My songs arent good enough for your restaurant?
 Phoebe:Then whats wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
 Phoebe:Yeah well excuse me I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer but (peering through her spectacles) I cant see it I cant see it!
 Phoebe:Well...its not about quality.
 Phoebe:Well at least all my songs dont taste like garlic. Yeah there are other ingredients Monica.
 Phoebe:Ear plugs or cloves of garlic?
 Phoebe:What are people having the garlic Martini?
 Phoebe:(singing) Food here at Javu..will kill you..the food here at Javu ...will kill you..
 Phoebe:Youd better get back in that kitchen Monica the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
 Phoebe:Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
 Phoebe:(while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
 Phoebe:Ok ok how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!
 Phoebe:Ok well who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
 Phoebe:Ok well alright who thinks the food is fine the music was fine but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
 Phoebe:Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friends cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
 Phoebe:Im sorry too... (they hug)
 Phoebe:Yeah! As long as its free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
 Phoebe:(smiling raising her hand) Whos hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you wont hate me?
 Phoebe:What is it?
 Phoebe:I know I know we can drive we can vote we can work what more do these broads want?
 Phoebe:Hi!
 Phoebe:Oh youre a paleonthologist too! (pause) Oh ok now what do you think of Ranions new theory of species variegation in segmented arthopods?
 Phoebe:Ah ah.
 Phoebe:Yeah I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
 Phoebe:Joeys having a party and he wasnt gonna invite us?
 Phoebe:And that horrible museum tour!
 Phoebe:We know about your party Joey.
 Phoebe:Hey!
 Phoebe:Monica you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)
 Phoebe:Hey Ross!
 Phoebe:Oh Whats the matter?
 Phoebe:Worse?
 Phoebe:(still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoths tusks)
 Phoebe:Hey Ross! So listen about you and the dinosaur girl are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that come on a piece of paper?
 Phoebe:Go Charlie! But my point is ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe shes looking to you know slum it with some average Joe Phd.
 Phoebe:Youre so much more than just brains! Youre sweet and kind and funny...
 Phoebe:Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
 Phoebe:Good for you! And hey I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
 Phoebe:Hey thank you so much for these tickets Chandler.
 Phoebe:Wow Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joeys raw sexual magnetism... Oh those nerds will get laaaaaid!
 Phoebe:(entering) Hey!
 Phoebe:Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
 Phoebe:I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
 Phoebe:Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
 Phoebe:(coming back from the bathroom) Whats up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachels hands) Hey Rachel!!
 Phoebe:No you cant go there! You know how I feel about these big massage places! Theyre putting people like me out of business!
 Phoebe:Ok this is not about the MONEY ok? Its about... its about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
 Phoebe:Well do you care about friendship?
 Phoebe:I feel really strongly about this Rachel. Please dont use this gift certificate. Im asking you as a friend.
 Phoebe:Promise?
 Phoebe:Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
 Phoebe:Ok. Do we have to talk like that then theyre not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh no no! Listen is there someone who can fill in for me?
 Phoebe:But that woman cant know I work here. Shes a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
 Phoebe:Cause its good money! But that doesnt change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
 Phoebe:(watching around and whispering) Ok are they listening?
 Phoebe:(In a strange heavy accent) Hello ja its time for your massage ja! Put your face in the hole.
 Phoebe:Okay then Im Swedish...
 Phoebe:Its a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
 Phoebe:Ja!
 Phoebe:(pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
 Phoebe:Is something wrong?
 Phoebe:(Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
 Phoebe:(Singing) Ipan Stripan Glupi Glabi!  And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
 Phoebe:Oh Ja! Ja!
 Phoebe:Uhu uhu... and why do you think that is?
 Phoebe:Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because youre such a high maintenance tight ass!
 Phoebe:You know its me?
 Phoebe:How can you come here?
 Phoebe:I dont have to tell you everything!
 Phoebe:Tips not included.
 Phoebe:Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical and dental and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now Im this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
 Phoebe:You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. Its time I took my life back!
 Phoebe:Ok.
 Phoebe:Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too I didnt mean any of that. I love you.
 Phoebe:(imitating the receptionists tone) Good morning receptionist.
 Phoebe:Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch she came back?
 Phoebe:(through the door with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole lassy.
 Phoebe:(entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok great! All right bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others then back at the phone) Thats off right?
 Phoebe:Oh... Mikes sister just invited me to a party tonight hes gonna be there. And she was like Oh dont worry! I asked him. Hes totally ok with seeing you!. So now I have to go so hell think that Im totally ok with seeing him!
 Phoebe:Exactly!

 Phoebe:Ok thatll be great!
 Phoebe:Oh Ill take some of that.
 Phoebe:No I know this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause Im gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.
 Phoebe:Ok. Oh good Im dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
 Phoebe:(picks up a dress) Hey Rach will you come with me to a dressing room?
 Phoebe:Ok!
 Phoebe:So what were you doing out there do you not like Charlie?
 Phoebe:Why?
 Phoebe:Who else?
 Phoebe:You like Joey?

 Phoebe:Uh wow! Isnt it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
 Phoebe:Oh well as long as it is under control you know you cant do anything about it hes already dating her and she is a nice person that wouldnt be right.
 Phoebe:Yeah.
 Phoebe:Sure!
 Phoebe:Oh.
 Phoebe:Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
 Phoebe:Well maybe she didnt hear! Ok Im gonna go into that dressing room you stay in here and Ill talk and see if you can hear me.
 Phoebe:(sticks her head out) I didnt say anything yet!
 Phoebe:(goes back in) Im Rachel. Its so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
 Phoebe:(comes out too) Well some things are just hard to say to your face.
 Phoebe:Ooh! We have a problem.
 Phoebe:Good plan.
 Phoebe:Oh! Im sorry Rachel I dont have time for your childish games ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at whos more over who! (at which she walks away)
 Phoebe:Are you sure? Because Im really dreading going to this party.
 Phoebe:Mike knows Im coming and if I dont show up hell think its because of him! And I dont want to lose face! Thats a very serious thing in my culture.
 Phoebe:You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made ok because I just dont want to go back to the Emergency Room.

 Phoebe:Oh my God! (they hug)
 Phoebe:Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
 Phoebe:What happened?

 Phoebe:I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok so were both living in New York not seeing anyone. Thats so not like us!
 Phoebe:Well... (pause) no.
 Phoebe:Id love to.
 Phoebe:Ok. (they walk away together)
 Phoebe:Oh got it stay upwind of me.
 Phoebe:I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
 Phoebe:No no because you know hes been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight hell die.
 Phoebe:Oh I should go too. Oh now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
 Phoebe:Mike?? Whos Mike?
 Phoebe:Thats right! Oh yeah... Well Ive totally forgotten about im! AH! Thats-Thats... a blast from the past!

 Phoebe:Wow? Really? Thats fantastic!
 Phoebe:Oh ok you want me to marry Mike? Alright well lets just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it Mike do you take Phoebe... (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout No! No!) You know its every girls dream!

 Phoebe:Sure ok yeah.
 Phoebe:Oh my God Mike!
 Phoebe:No Mikes here.
 Phoebe:What are you what are you doing here?
 Phoebe:(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!
 Phoebe:I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere you know that we had a future.
 Phoebe:David Im so sorry Im sorry.
 Phoebe:Yeah I might have said yes but that would have been wrong.
 Phoebe:Yes! (they hug)
 Phoebe:Well on the bright side now you wont have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!
 Phoebe:... and...?
